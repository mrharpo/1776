MUSICAL NUMBERS

 SCENE 1
In front of the curtain.
JoHN ADAMS:
I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace, that two are called a Jaw firm, and that three or more become a congress, And by God, I have had this Congress! For ten years King George and his Parliament have gulled, cullied, and
diddied these Colonies with their illegal taxes— Stamp Acts, Townshend Acts, Sugar Acts, Tea Acts—and when we dared stand up like men they stopped our trade, seized our ships, blockaded our ports, burned our towns, and spilled our blood-— and stili this Congress won’t grant any of my pro- posals on Independence even so much as the cour- tesy of open debate! Good God, what in hell are
they waiting for?
The curtain flies up to reveal the Chamber of the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, At rise, Congress is in session, sweltering in the heat of a@premature summer's evening, A large day-by-day wall calendar reads: “MAY 8.”
CONGRESS: singing:
Sit down, John!
Sit down, John!
For God’s sake, John Sit down!
Sit down, John!
Sit down, John!
For God’s sake, John. Sit down!

SCENE 1 / 1776
VOICES FROM CONGRESS A:
Are you going to open up a window?
Coneress A: Can't we
Compromise here?
JOHN:
_ Vote Yest
Concress B:
No, too many
Flies here!
JOHN:
Vote Yes!
Conerzss, full:
Oh, for God’s sake, John, Sit down!
They freeze.

JOHN, speaks, roaring:
Good God!! Consider yourselves fortunate that you have John Adams to abuse, for no sane man would tolerate it!
CONGRESS, resuming action, singing: John, you’re a bore!
We've heard this before! Now, for God’s sake, John, Sit down!
JOHN:
Isay, “Vote Yes!”
SOME VOICES: Nol!
JOHN:
Vote Yes!
;

 4 scENE 1 / 1776
Conaress, full; Nol!
JouN:
Vote for
Independency!
Conoress A:
Someone ought toopen up awindow!
JOHN:
Isay “Vote Yes!”
Conoress, full:
Sit down, John!
JOHN:
Vote for independency!!!
VOICE:
Will someone shut that man up!!
Joun, speaking:
Never! Never! [He storms from the Chamber, com- ing downstage, and looks to Heaven for guidance.| Dear God! For one solid year they have been sit- ting therefor one year! Doing nothing!
Singing:
1 do believe you've laid a curse on North America!
A curse that we here now rehearse in Philadelphia!
A second Flood, a simple famine, Plagues of locusts-everywhere,
Or acataclysmic earthquake,
I'd accept with some despair.
But, no, you’ve sent us Congress—. Good God, Sir, was that fair?

 Isay this with humility in Philadelphia!
We're your responsibility in Philadelphia!
If you don’t want to see us hanging
On some far-off British hill,
If you don’t want the voice of independency Forever stil,
Then, God, Sir, get Thee to it,
For Congress never will!
You see we
Piddle, twiddle, and resolve.
Not one damned thing do we solve. Piddle, twiddle, and resolve. Nothing’s ever solved in
Foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy
Philadelphia!
From the Chamber, rear, aCongressional voice can be heard,
VoIce:
Someone ought to open up a window!
JOHN, speaking: Oh, shut up!
JoHN HANCOCK:
I now call the Congress’ attention to the petition of Mr. Melchior Meng, who claims twenty dollars’ compensation for his dead mule. It seems the ani- mal was employed transporting luggage in the serv- ice of the Congress.
JAMES WILSON:
The question, then, would appear to be one of occasion, for if the mule expired not while carrying, but after being unloaded, then surely the beast dropped dead on its own time!

JOHN:
Good Godl!
Singing:
They may sit here for years and years in Philadelphia!
These indecisive grenadiers of
Philadelphia! Theycan’tagreeonwhatisrightorwrong _ Or what is good or bad.
I’m convinced the only purpose This Congress ever had
Was to gather here, specifically, To drive John Adams mad!
You see we
Piddle, twiddle, and resolve.
Not one damned thing do we solve. Piddle, twiddle, and resolve
Nothing’s ever solved in
Foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy Philadelphia—-
Abigail Adams, John's wife, a handsome woman of thirty-two, now appears in John’s imagination and interrupts.
ABIGAIL:
John, John!
Is that you carrying on, John?
JOHN, speaking: .
Oh, Abigail! Abigail—I have such a desire to knock heads together!
ABIGAIL:
Iknow, my dearest. Iknow. But that’s because you
make everything so complicated. It’s al quite simple, really:

 SCENE1 / 1776 7 Singing:
Tell the Congress to declare Independency!
Then sign your name, get out of there, and hurry home to me!
Our children al have dysentery,
Little Tom keeps turning blue.
Little Abby has the measles
And I’m coming down with flu.
They say we may get smalipox—~
JOHN, speaking:
Madame, what else is new?
Music under.
Abigail, in my last letter I told you that the King has collected twelve thousand German mercenaries to.send against us. I asked you to organize the ladies and make saltpetre for gunpowder. Have
you done as Iasked?
ABIGAIL:
No, John, Ihave not.
JOHN:
Why have you not?
ABIGAIL:
Because you neglected to tel us how saltpetre is made.
JOHN, impatient:
By treating sodium nitrate with potassium chloride, of course!
ABIGAIL~—a woman:
Oh, yes——of course.
JOHN:
Will itbe done, then?

 ABIGAIL:
I’m afraid we have a more urgent problem, John.
JOHN:
More urgent, Madame?
ABIGAIL, singing:
There’s one thing every woman’s missed in Massachusetts Bay—
Don’t smirk at me, you egotist, pay
Heed towhat Isay!
We've gone from Framingham to Boston And cannot find apin.
“Don’t you know there isawar on?” Says each tradesman with agrin. Well!
We will not make saltpetre
Until you send us pins!
JOHN:
Pins, Madame? Saltpetre?
ABIGAIL: Pins!
JOHN AND ABIGAIL, alternating: Saltpetre!
Pins! Saltpetre!
Pins! Saltpetre!
Pins! "Petre!
Pins! *Petrel
Pins! "Petre!
Pins! ’Petrel

JouNn, speaking, beaten: Done, Madame. Done.
ABIGAIL;
Done, John. [Smiling:} Hurry home, John.
JoHNn:
As soon as I’m able,
ABIGAIL:
Don’t stop writing—-it’s alIhave,
JOHN:
Every day, my dearest friend.
ABIGAIL, singing: Till then...
ABIGAIL AND JOHN: Till then,
I am, as I ever was, and ever shall be—~ Yours...
Yours...

Yours... Yours...
JOHN:
Saltpetre. [He throws a kiss.} John.
ABIGAIL:
Pins. [She throws a kiss.) Abigail. She goes.
CONGRESS, singing:
For God’s sake, John, Sit down!
John turns, waves them off in disgust, then crosses.
Joun, calling: Franklin!

 SCENE 2
The Mall. Sunlight. Benjamin Franklin sits on a bench, having his portrait painted.
John discovers him.
JOHN:
Franklin! Where in God’s name were you when I needed you?
FRANKLIN:
Right here, John, being preserved for posterity. Do y'like it?
JOHN, after examining the painting carefully: It stinks.
The painter goes. FRANKLIN:
As ever, the soul of tact.
JOHN:
The man’s no Botticelli.
FRANKLIN:
And the subject’s no Venus.
JOHN:
Franklin! You heard what Isuffered inthere?
FRANKLIN:
Heard? Of course 1 heard—along with the rest of Philadelphia. Lord, your voice is piercing, John!
JOHN:
I wish to heaven my arguments were. By God, Franklin, when will they make up their minds? With-one hand they can raise an army, dispatch

one of their own to lead it, and cheer the news from Bunker’s Hill—while with the other they wave the olive branch, begging the King for a happy and permanent reconciliation. Why damn it,Fat George has declared us in rebellion—why in bloody hell can’t they?
FRANKLIN;
-John, really! You taik as if independence were the
rule! It’s never been done before! No colony has ever broken from the parent stem in the. history of the world!
JouN:
Dammit, Franklin, you make us sound treasonous!
FRANKLIN:
Do I? [Thinking:] Treason—-“Treason is a charge invented by winners as an excuse for hanging the losers,”
JOHN:
I have more to do than stand here listening to you quote yourself,
FRANKLIN:
No, that: was a new one!
JOHN:
Dammit, Franklin, we’re at war!
FRANKLIN:
To defend ourselves, nothing more. We expressed our displeasure, the English moved against us, and we, in turn, have resisted, Now our fellow Con- gressmen want to effect a reconciliation before it becomes awar.
JOHN;
Reconcilation my ass! The people want independ- ence}

 12 scens2 / 1776
FRANKLIN:
The people have read Mr, Paine’s Common Sense. I doubt the Congress has. [He studies him.j John, why don’t you give it up? Nobody listens to you— you’re obnoxious and disliked.
JOHN:
Y'm not promoting John Adams, I’m promoting in- dependence.
FRANKLIN:
Evidently they cannot help connecting the two.
JOHN, suspicious:
What are you suggesting?
FRANKLIN; —
Let someone else in Congress propose.
JOHN: Never!
Franklin shrugs.
Who did you have in mind?
FRANKLIN:
I don’t know. I really haven’t given it much thought.
Richard Henry Lee, a tall, loose-jointed Virginian aristocrat of forty-five, enters.
Leg:
You sent for me, Benjamin?
JouN, looking at Lee, then at Franklin: Never!!
LEE;
Halloo, Johnny.

 JOHN, nodding: Richard,
FRANKLIN:
Richard, John and Ineed some advice,
LEB:
If it’s mine t’give, it’s yours, y’know that.
FRANKLIN:
Thank you, Richard, As you know, the cause that we support has come to a complete standstill. Now, why do you suppose that is?
LEE:
Simple! Johnny, here, isobnoxious and disliked.
FRANKLIN:
Yes, that’s true. What’s the solution, Iwonder?
LEE it’sobvious:
Get someone else in Congress to propose—~
FRANKLIN:
Richard, that’s brilliant! Wasn’t that brilliant, John?
JouN, dully: Brilliant.
FRANKLIN:
Yes. Now the question remains—who can it be? The man we need must belong to a delegation pub- licly committed to support independence, and at the present time only Massachusetts, New Hamp- shire, and Delaware have declared our way.
LEE:
And Virginia, Benjy—don’t forget Virginia,
FRANKLIN;
Oh, I haven’t, Richard—how could 1? But strictly speaking, while Virginia's views on independence

FRANKLIN AND ADAMS, together: Who?
are well known, your legislature in Williamsburg has never formally authorized its delegation here in Congress to support the cause. Of course, if we could think of a Virginian with enough influence to go down there and persuade the House of Bur- gesses—

 My name isRichard Henry Lee!

LEE, singing:
They say that God in Heaven Iseverybody’s God,
FRANKLIN: Amen!
LEE:
Vl admit that God in Heaven Iseverybody’s God.
But I tell y’, John, with pride, God leans a little on the side
Of the Lees! The Lees of old Virginia! Y’see it’s
Here a Lee, there a Lec

He begins strutting, a military cakewalk.
Yes sir, by God, it’s

There aLee!
Come on, boys, join in with me!
They do, John reluctantly.
Here aLec! There aLee!

And I’lcome back Triumphant-Lee/
FRANKLIN AND JOHN:
Here a Lee! There a Lee! Ev’rywhere aLee! A Lee!
LEE: . Forrr-watr...
Ho-ooo!
Lee struts off. Franklin and John follow him almost as far as the wings, then drop out and return, breathless but relieved.
JOHN, speaking:
That was the most revolting display I ever wit- nessed,
FRANKLIN:
They’re awarm-blooded people, Virginians!
JOHN:
Not him, Franklin—-you! You and your infernal obsession for deviousness! If you’d come right out and asked him straight, he’d’ve been gone a half hour ago!
FRANKLIN:
Cheer up, John. At this yery moment our cause is again riding high—sitting straight in the saddle and in full gallop for Virginia!
Lee suddenly reappears.
LEE, sinving:
~~And our women are... Serene...
JOHN, speaking: Oh, good God!
LEE:
Full-bosomed . ..

 SCENE2 /{ 1776 19
FRANKLIN, perking up: Full-bosomed?
LEE:
Full-bosomed, Benjy,
Every one a queen! Why, they are...
Music in, at tempo,
-~Lees! Dammit!
The Lees of old Virginia! Yes, sir! By God!
Waving his riding crop, he parades around, fol- lowed by Franklin and John.
ALL:
It’s here a Lee!
There a Lec}
LEE;
Come on, John,
Step live-a-Lee/
ALL:
Here aLee!
There aLee!
Everywhere aLee—a Lee!
Again Lee starts off, strutting. between, but ahead of, John and Franklin, who are halfheartedly marching after him, Suddenly Lee has stil another afterthought and turns back to express it-—but John and Franklin are ready for him this time, hooking his arms as he passes between them, and dragging the surprised and frustrated Virginian off backwards.

 SCENE 3
The Chamber.
Featured prominently, rear, is a tally board. Under three main headings (YEA, NAY, and ABSTAIN) are thirteen slots, each with a shuttle containing the name of a single coiony. This device, during a vote, is the province of the Secretary of the Congress.
At rise, the Chamber is empty save for its aging custodian, Andrew McNair, who is preparing the room for the day’s session with the help of a Leather Apron, a working man. The wall calen- dar now reads: “JUNE 7,” Then, as McNair sets out quill pens and fills the several inkwells from a large jar, Georgia’s Dr. Lyman Hall, fifty-five, en- ters and looks around, finally clearing his threat. McNair leoks up.
McNalrrR: -Yes?
HALL:
I'm Dr. Lyman Hail, a new delegate from Georgia.
McNan:
I’m Andrew McNair, Congressional Custodian. [He goes hack to work.} lf you'll be wantin’ any- thing at al just holler out, “McNair!” as you'll hear the others do, and there won't be too long to wait.
HALL, fooking around:
Where does the Georgia deicgation belong?
McNair:
Oh, they mill about over in that corner—near the two Carolinas,

 HALL, checking his watch:
It’s after ten, I was told the Congress convenes at ten,
MCNar:
They'll be wanderin’ in any time now, sir—with Old Grape ’n’ Guts leadin’ the pack.
HALL:
Old who?
HopkIns’ Voice, offstage: McNairll
MCNAIR:
Grape ’n’Guts.
Stephen Hopkins, a thin round-shouldered man of seventy, wearing a black suit, black Quaker hat, his gray hair at shoulder length, enters.
HOopkKINs:
Fetch me amug o’rum!
McNarRr:
Mr. Hopkins, you’ll be pleased to meet Dr. Lyman Hall—
Hopkins:
Idon’t need adoctor, dammit—
McNAIR:
—new delegate from Georgia—
Hopkins;
Why didn’t you say so? [To Hall:] I'm Stephen Hopkins, old delegate from Rhode Island. McNair! Two mugs o’rum!
HALL:
I fear it’s a little early in the day—
Hopkins:
Nonsense! It’s a medicinal fact that rum gets a

a
 McNar:
Ben Franklin’s older by almost ayear—-
HOPKINS: Rumi!
McNair scurries off.
RUTLEDGE:
With South Carolina, of course.
Hopkins, laughing:
Good morning, Neddy. Shake the hand of Dr. Ly- man Hall from Georgia. Doctor, this here is Ed- ward Rutledge from whichever Carolina he says he’s from—God knows Ican’t keep ’em straight.
RUTLEDGE:
A pleasure, Dr. Hall.
HALL:
Your servant, Mr. Rutledge.
RUTLEDGE:
Except for Ben Franklin—
HopkIns: MecNair!!
22
SCENE 3 / 1776
man’s heart started in the morning—I’m surprised you didn’t know it. And speaking as the oldest man in the Congress—
Tell me, Dr. Hall, where does Georgia stand on the question of independence?
Edward Rutledge, a young, handsome, dandified aristocrat of twenty-six, has entered.
Hopkins:
You’ve met the long and short of it now, Doctor. Neddy here is only twenty-six; he’s the youngest ofus—

 SCENE 3 / 1776 23
McNair has returned and now stands at Hopkins’ elbow.
MCNAIR:
Your rum,
Hopkins:
Where'd y’go for it, man—Jamaica?
Rutledge and Hall walk away.
RUTLEDGE:
Where does Georgia stand on independence at the present time, Dr. Hall? ,
HALL:
Iam here without instructions, able to vote my own personal convictions,
RUTLEDGE:
And they are—?
HALL, apause; he examines him: Personal,
RUTLEDGE:
Dr. Hall, the Deep South speaks with one voice. It istraditional—even more, itishistorical,
They regard one another for amoment. Then the Delaware delegation enters: Caesar Rodney, forty- eight, thin and pale, wears a green scarf tied around his face, covering some infirmity; George Read, forty-three, small and round, speaks with a high voice; and Colonel Thomas McKean, forty- two, tall and florid, has a booming voice decorated with a Scottlsh brogue. As always, the three are arguing,
Enter Delaware—tria juncta in uno!

 24 SCENE 3 / 1776
McKEAN:
Speak plain, Rutledge, y’know I can’t follow none o’y’rdamn French!
RUTLEDGE:
Latin, Colonel McKean~~a tribute to the eternal peace and harmony of the Delaware delegation.
McKean:
What're y’sayin’, man? Y’know perfectly well neither Rodney nor I can stand this little wart! [He indicates Read.]}
RUTLEDGE:
Gentlemen, gentlemen, this is Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia—-Caesar Rodney, George Read, and Col- onel Thomas McKean.
Hall shakes hands with each in turn and they ex change greetings.
RODNEY:
Where do you stand on independence, sir?
HALL—a look to Rutledge:
With South Carolina, itseems.
RUTLEDGE:
I leave the doctor in your excellent company, gentlemen.
Smiling, he bows and walks away, joining another group.
Slowly the Chamber has begun to fil with Con- gressmen: Lewis Morris and Robert Livingston of New York; Roger Sherman of Connecticut; Joseph Hewes of North Coralina; the portly Samuel Chase of Maryland; Josiah Bartlett of New Hampshire; others; and last to enter, unnoticed, Thomas Jeffer- son of Virginia, thirty-three, six feet three, with
copper-colored hair, carrying several books.

 SCENE3 / 1776 25
RODNEY, drawing Hall aside:
Tell me, sir, would you be a doctor of medicine or theology?
HALL:
Both, Mr. Rodney. Which one can be of service?
RODNEY, good-naturedly:
By al means the physiclan first! Then we shall see about the other.
HALL, smiling:
V'li cal at your convenience, sir.
They are joined by two members of the Pennsyl- vania delegation: John Dickinson, forty-four, a thin, hawkish man, not without elegance, and James Wilson, thirty-three, a bespectacled, cautious little sycophant,
DICKINSON, pleasantly:
I trust, Caesar, when you're through converting the poor fellow to independency that you'll give the opposition a fair crack at him.
RODNEY:
You're too late, John; once I get ’em they’re got. Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia--Mr. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania:
DICKINSON:
An honor, sir.
HALL:
Your servant.
WILSON, waiting: Ahem,
RODNEY:
Ah, Judge Wilson, forgive me—but how can any- one see you if you insist on standing in Mr. Dickin-

 26 scenz3 /{ 1776
son’s shadow? [To Hall] James Wilson, also of Pennsylvania.
WILSON: Sir.
HALL:
An honor, sir.
Franklin enters, limping on a cane, one joot ban- daged,
FRANKLIN:
Will you get out of my way, please? Good morning, al!
HALL, recognizing him:
Good Lord, do you have the honor to be Dr, Franklin?
FRANKLIN:
Yes, I have that honor-—unfortunately the gout ac- companies the honor.
Hopkins:
Been living too high again, ch, Pappy?
FRANKLIN:
Stephen, I only wish King Gcorge felt like my big toe——all over!
HOorKINs:
MeNair!! Fetch a pillow-—and two more mugs of rum!
Now John enters the Chamber and looks around, searching for someone,
It iy now evident that the colors and styles of the various costumes change gradually from colony to colony—from the fancy greens and golds of the Deep South to the somber blacks of New England.

 FRANKLIN:
Good morning, John!
JOHN, joining him:
Well, Franklin? Where’s that idiot Lee? Has he returned yet? Idon’t see him.
FRANKLIN:
Softly, John-—~your voice is hurting my foot.
JOHN;
One more day, Franklin—that’s how long I'l! re- main silent, and not a minute longer! That strutting popinjay was so damned sure of himself, He’s had time to bring back a dozen proposals by now!
Dickinson turns to Wilson and addresses him in a loud voice, for all to hear.
DICKINSON:
Tell me, James, how do you explain the strange, monumental quietude that Congress has been treated to these past thirty days?
Everyone, including.John, has turned to listen.
Has the il wind of independence finally blown it- self out?
WILSON:
Ifyou ask me—
DICKINSON;
For myself, I must confess that a month free from New England noise is more therapeutic than a month in the country! Don’t you agree, James?
WILSON:
Well, I-—-
DICKINSON, turning:
Mr. Adams, pray look for your voice, sir! It cannot be far and God knows we need the entertainment in this Congress!
SCENE'3 /{ 1776 27

 28 scENE3 / 1776
Laughter from his fellow conservatives. Everyone turns to Adams, who is trembling with rage.
FRANKLIN:
Congratulations, John, you’ve just made your great- est contribution to independence—you kept your flap shut!
JOHN:
One more day... !
John Hancock, forty, takes his place at the Presi- dent’s desk; he is followed by Charles Thomson, forty-seven, the pedantic Secretary to the Congress. Hancock pounds his gavel.
HANCOCK:
Gentlemen, the usual morning festivities concluded, I will now call the Congress to order. [Gavel-] Mr. Thomson.
THOMSON, rising and ringing a bell:
The Second Continental Congress, meeting in the city of Philadelphia, is now in session, seventh June, seventeen seventy-six, the three hundred eightieth mecting.
McNAIR:
Sweet Jesus!
THOMSON:
The Honorable John Hancock of Massachusetts Bay, President. [He rings the bells and sits.]
HANCOCK:
Thank you, Mr. Thomson. [He swats a fly.] Mr. MeNair, the stores of rum and other drinking Spirits are hereby closed to the colony of Rhode Island for a period of three days.

HANCOCK—sorry he brought itup:

JEFFERSON, smiling: Yes, sir, 1will.
A uniformed courier, dusty from his long ride, en« ters and approaches Thomson, removing a com~ muniqué from his pouch. He tosses itonto the Sec~ retary’s desk and leaves wearily.
THOMSON, ringing his beil:
From the Commander, Army of the United Colo- nies; in New York, dispatch number one thousand, one hundred and thirty-seven—
MCNar:
Sweet Jesus!
THOMSON, reading:
“To the Honorable Congress, John Hancock, Presi-

 dent. Dear Sir: It is with grave apprehension that I have learned this day of the sailing, from Halifax,
Nova Scotia, of a considerable
troops in the company of foreign mercenaries and under the command of General Sir William Howe. There can be no doubt that their destination is New York, for to take and hold this city and the Hudson Valley beyond would serve to separate New Eng- land from the other colonies permitting both sec- tions to be crushed in turn, Sadly, I see no way of stopping them at the present time as my army is absolutely falling apart, my military chest is totally
exhausted, my Commissary General has strained his credit to the Jast, my Quartermaster has no food, no arms, no ammunition, and my troops are in a state of near mutiny! I pray God some relief arrives before the armada but fear it will not. Y’r ob’d’t—”

McKEan:
Surely we’ve managed to promote the gloomiest man on this continent to the head of our troops. Those dispatches are the most depressing accumu- lation of disaster, doom, and despair in the entire annals of military history! And furthermore—

Cheers from those for independence.
Mr. President, I have returned from Virginia with the followin’ resolution. [He produces a paper and reads.] “Resolved: that these united colonies are (and of a right ought to be) free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that al political connec- tion between them and the state of Great Britain is (and ought to be) totally dissolved!”
JOHN:
Mr. President, Isecond the proposal!
A silence; then Hancock swats a fly.
HANCOCK:
The resolution has been proposed and seconded, The Chair will now entertain debate,
DICKINSON, rising, assuming weariness:
Mr. President, Pennsylvania moves, as always, that the question of independence be postponed—in- definitely,

However-—-we in the Deep South, un- like our fricnds in New England, have no cause for impatience at the present time. If, at some future date, it becomes the wish of all our sister colonies to effect a separation, we will not stand in the way. But for the time bein’, South Carolina will wait— and watch.

Understanding laughter.
But I’m afraid I’m not yet certain whether repre- senting the people means relying on their judgment or on my own. So in al fairness, until I can figure it out, I'd better lean a little toward their side. Georgia says Nay.

The Chair now declares this Congress a commit- tee-of-the-whole for the purpose of debating Vir- ginia’s resolution of independence. Mr. Dickinson.

 scENE 3 / 1776 39
DICKINSON:
Weill, now. You’ve got your way at last, Mr. Adams——the matter may now be discussed. 1 con- fess I'm almost relicved. There’s a question I’ve been fairly itching to ask you: Why?
JOHN:
Why what, Mr. Dickinson?
DICKINSON:
Why independence, Mr. Adams?
JOHN:
For the obvious reason that our continued associa- tion with Great Britain has grown intolcrablc.
DICKINSON;
To whom, Mr. Adams? To you? Then T suggest you scver your tics immediately. But please be kind cnough to Icave the rest of us where we are. Personally, 1have no objections at al to being part of the greatest empire on carth, to enjoying its protcetion and sharing its bencfits—
JOHN;
Benefits? What bencfits? Crippling taxes? Crucl repressions? Abolished rights?
DICKINSON:
Is that al England mcans to you, sir? Is that al the affection and pride you can muster for the nation that bore you——for the noblest, most civi- lized nation on the face of this planet? Would you have us forsake Hastings and Magna Carta, Strong- bow and Lionhcartcd, Drake and Marlborough, Tudors, Stuarts, and Plantagenets? For what, sir? Tell me for what? For you?
He smiles, then turns.
Some men are patriots, like General Washington-— some are anarchists, like Mr. Painc-—some cvcen

 SCENE3 / 1776
are internationalists, like Dr. Franklin. But you, sir, you are merely an a-gi-ta-tor, disturbing the peace, creating disorder, endangering the public welfare—and for what? Your petty litle personal complaints, Your taxes are too high. Well, sir, so . are mine. Come, come, Mr. Adams, if you have grievances—and I’m sure you have—our present system must provide a gentler means of redressing them short of-~-[suddenly his manner changes as he brings his fist down on the desk with a crash] ——-revolution!! [Wheeling to the Congress] That's what he wants—nothing less will satisfy him! Vio- lence! Rebellion! Treason! Now, Mr. Adams, are these the acts of Englishmen?
JouN:
Not Englishmen, Dickinson—-Americans!
DICKINSON, again pounding the desk: No, sir! Englishmen!!
FRaNKLIN-——he’s been asleep, his chin on his chest; now an eye opens:
Please, Mr. Dickinson—but must you start bang- ing? How is a man to sleep?
Laughter.
DICKINSON:
Forgive me, Dr, Franklin, but must you start speaking? How is a man to stay awake?
Laughter,
We'll promise to be quiet, sir. I’m sure everyone prefers that you remain aslecp.
FRANKLIN:
If I’m to hear myself called an Englishman, sir, then I assure you I’d prefer I'd remained asleep.

 SCENE3 / 1776 41
DICKINSON:
What's so terrible about being called an English- man? The English don’t seem to mind.
FRANKLIN:
Nor would I, were I given the full rights of an
Englishman. But to call me one without those
rights is like calllng an ox a bull—he’s thankful
for the honor but he’d much rather have restored
what’s rightfully his. i
Laughter, Franklin laughing the longest.
DICKINSON, finally:
When did you first notice they were missing, sir?
Laughter,
Fortunately, Dr. Franklin, the people of these colonies maintain a higher regard for their mother country.
FRANKLIN;
Higher, certainly, than she feels for them. Never was such a yaluable possession so stupidly and recklessly managed than this entire continent by the British Crown. Our industry discouraged, our resources pillaged—-and, worst of ail, our very - character stifled. We’ve spawned a new race here— rougher, simpler, more violent, more enterprising, and less refined. We’re a new nationality, Mr.
Dickinson—-we require anew nation.
DICKINSON:
That may be your opinion, Dr. Franklin, but as I said, the people feel quite differently.
You don’t speak for the people: you represent only yourself. And that precious “status quo” you

keep imploring the people to preserve for their own good is nothing more than the etcrnal preser- vation of your own property!
DICKINSON:
Mr. Adams, you have an annoying talent for mak- ing such delightful words as “property” sound quite distasteful. In Heaven’s name, what’s wrong with property? Perhaps you’ve forgotten that many of us first came to these shores in order to secure rights to property—and that we hold those rights no less dear than the rights you speak of.
JOHN:
So safe, so fat, so comfortable in Pennsylvania—
DICKINSON;
And what is this independence of yours exccpt the private grievance of Massachusetts? Why, even your own cousin, so busy now with his seditious activitics in Boston that he has no time to attend this Congress, is a fugitive with a price on his head!
HANCOCK:
Slowly, Mr. Dickinson. 1 remind you that the same price that covers Sam Adams also covefs mc— we are wanted together,
DICKINSON: ‘
What did you expect? You both dress up like red savages in order to commit piracy against onc of His Majesty’s ships—an event so embarrassing to your sister colonics that even your good friend Dr. Franklin offered to pay for al that spilt tea from his own pocket!
FRANKLIN:
I’m usually able to speak for myself, Mr. Dickin- son.

 SCENE3 / 1776 43
DICKINSON:
Then tel me this: what good can come from this radicalism and civil disorder? Where can it lead except to chaos, mob rule, and anarchy? And why in God’s name is it always Boston that breaks the King’s peace? [To the Congress:] My dear Con- gress you must not adopt this evil measure. It is the work of the devil. Leave it where it belongs-—- inNew England.
SHERMAN:
Brother Dickinson, New England his been fighting the devil for more than a hundred years.
DICKINSON:
And as of now, “Brother” Sherman, the devil has been winning hands down! [Indicating John:] Why, at this very moment he is sitting here in this Con- gress! Don’t let him deceive you-—this proposal is entirely his doing! It may bear Virginia’s name, but it reeks of Adams, Adams, and more Adams! Look at him—ready to lead this continent down the fiery path of total destruction!
JOHN:
Good God! Why can’t you acknowledge what al- ready exists? It has been more than a year since Concord and Lexington. Dammit, man, we’re at war right now!
DICKINSON:
You may be at war—you: Boston and John Ad- ams—but you will never speak for Pennsylvania!
READ, jumping up: Nor for Delaware!
RODNEY:
Mr. Read, you represent only one-third of Dela- ware!

HANCOCK, mopping his brow:

RUTLEDGE;
Mr. Adams, perhaps you could clear something up for me: after we have achieved independence, who do you propose would govern in South Caro- lina?
JOHN:
The people, of course.
RUTLEDGE;
Which people, sir? The people of South Carolina? Or the people of Massachusetts?
HOPKINS:
Why don’t you admit it, Neddy? You're against independence now, and you always will be.
McKean: Ayel

RUTLEDGE:
You refuse to understand us, gentlemen! We desire independence, yes—for South Carolina. That is our country. And as such we don’t wish it to be- long to anyone-~not to England, and not to you,
JOHN:
We intend to be one nation, Rutledge.
RUTLEDGE:
A nation of sovereign states, Mr. Adams, united for our mutual protection, but separate for our individual pursuits, That is what we have under- stood it to be, and that is what we will support— as soon as everyone supports it.
WILSON:
There you are, Mr. Adams, you must see that we need time to make certain who we are and where we stand in regard to one another—for if we do not determine the nature of the beast before we sct it free, it will end by consuming us ail.
Joun:
For once in your life, Wilson—-take a chance. I say the time is now! It may never come again!

Mr. Adams, how can a nation of only two million souls stand up to an cmpire of ten million? Think of it—-ten million! How do we compensate for that shortage?
FRANKLIN:
It’s simplc, Mr, Chase—incrcase and multiply!
CHASE:
How’s that?
JOHN:
.We will more than compensate—with spirit! I tel
you there’s a spirit out there with the pcople that’s sadly lacking in this Congress!
Dickinson:
Yes, of course——now it’s spirit! Why didn’t I think of that? No army, no navy, no arms, no ammuni- tion, no treasury, no fricnds—but, bless our soul, spirit!

RUTLEDGE: Hear, hear!

But it'l never be unanimous, dammit!
DICKINSON:
If you say so, Mr. Adams.
THOMSON:
It has been moved and seconded that the vote on independence must be unanimous in order to carry. All those in favor signify by saying “Yea”.

Mr. Secretary, New York abstains—courteously.
HANCOCK;
Mr. Morris, why does New York constantly ab- stain? Why doesn’t New York simply stay in New York? Very well, the vote is tied. [He covers his eyes for a moment.] The principles of independ- ence have no greater advocate in Congress than its President—and that is why I must join those who vote for unanimity.
JOHN—as the Congress reacts, stunned, he jumps up, horrified: Good God! What’re y’doing, John? You've sunk us!
HANCOcK:
Hear me out, Don’t you see that any colony who opposes independence will be forced to fight on the side of England—that we’ll be setting brother against brother, that our new nation will carry as its emblem the mark of Cain? I can see no other way. Either we walk together or together we must stay where we are.

Why, Mr. Dickinson, I’m surprised at you! You should know that rebellion is always Icgal in the first person—such as “our” rebellion. It is only in the third person—“their” rebellion—that it is illegal.
Laughter,
Mr. President, I second the motion to postpone the vote on independence for a period of time sufficient for the writing of a declaration.
HANCOCK;
It has been moved and seconded. Mr. Secretary—
THOMSON:
All those in favor of the motion to postpone signify by saying “Yea.”
Adams, Bartlett, Hopkins, Sherman, Witherspoon, and Lee say “Yea.”
than that! Answer straight—what would te its purpose?
SCENE3 / 1776 55
JEFFERSON, rising and speaking deliberately;
To place before mankind the common sense of the subject, in terms so plain and firm as to command their. assent.

 Six colonies say “Nay.”
Morris:
Mr. Secretary, New York abstains—courteously.
Morais:
I'm sorry, Mr, President, but the simple fact is that our legislature has never sent up explicit instruc- tions on anything.
HANCOCK:
Never? That's impossible!
Morris:
Have you ever been present at a meeting of the New York legislature? They speak very fast and very loud and nobody pays any attention to any- body else, with the result that nothing ever gets done. Ibeg the Congress’ pardon.
HANCOCK:
My sympathies, Mr. Morris. The vote again being tied, the Chair decides in favor of the postpone- ment. [His gavel.] So ruled, A committee will now be formed to manage the declaration, said docu- ment to be written, debated, and approved by the beginning of July, three weeks hence, at which time Virginia’s resolution on independence will finally be voted. Is that clear? [Meeting general agree- ment:} Very well. Will the following gentiemen
serve on the Declaration Committee. Dr. Franklin,

Dickinson, Chase, Read, Rutledge, Hewes, and Hall say “Nay.”
HANCOCK, threatening him with his fly-swatter, then re- straining himself:
Mr. Morris! What in hell goes on in New York?

 SCENE3 / 1776 57
Mr. John Adams, Mr. Sherman, Mr. Livingston, and, of course, Mr. Lee.
LEE:
Excuse me, but Imust be returnin’ to the sovereign country of Virginia as I have been asked to serve as governor. Therefore I must decline—respectful- Lee!
HANCOCK:
Very well, Mr. Lee, you’re excused. I suppose we could leave itafour-man committee.
JOHN:
Just a moment. This business needs a Virginian. Therefore, Ipropose areplacement-—-Mr. Thomas Jefferson!
JEFFERSON:
No, Mr. Adams, no/
HANCOCK:
Very well, Mr. Adams, Mr. Jefferson will serve.
JEFFERSON:
I'm going home too—to my wife!
JOHN:
Move to adjourn!
JEFFERSON: No, wait—
FRANKLIN: Secondl!! ,
JEFFERSON:
It’s been six months since I've seen her!
HANCOCK:
Moved and seconded-—any objections?
JEFFERSON:
Yes! Ihave objections!

 58 SscENE3 /{ 1776
HANCOCK, gaveling:
So ruled, Congress stands adjourned!
JEFFERSON, on deaf ears:
I need to see my wife, I tel you!
Congress rises and goes as John, Franklin, Sher- man and Livingston move downstage, with Jeffer- son following, stillprotesting.
Music begins.
JOHN:
All right, gentlemen! Let’s get on with it. Which of us is going to write our declaration on independ- ence?
FRANKLIN, Singing:
Mr. Adams, Isay you should write it,
To your legal mind and brilliance we defer.
JOHN:
Is that so!
Weil, if I’m the one to do it,
They'll run their quill pens through it.
I’m obnoxious and disliked, you know that, sir!
FRANKLIN, speaking: Yes, Iknow.
JOHN:
Then ¥say you should write it,Franklin, yes, yout
FRANKLIN, singing: Hell, no!
Joun:
Yes, you, Dr. Franklin, you!
FRANKLIN: But—
JOHN: You!

FRANKLIN: But—-

FRANKLIN: But—

But-—-Mr. Adams!
The things Iwrite
Are only light extemporanea,
Iwon’t put politics on paper.
It’s amania.
So, Irefuse to use the pen——in Pennsylvania!
A Glee Club is formed by Sherman, Livingston, and Franklin,
GLEE CLus: Pennsylvania!
Pennsylvania! Refuse
To use .,. the pen!
John begins to pace, thinking.
JOHN:
Mr. Sherman, I say you should write it. You are never “controversial,” as it were.
SHERMAN, speaking: © That istrue.
JOHN, singing:
Whereas, if I’m the one to do it
They'll run their quill pens through it.
I’m obnoxious and disliked, you know that, sir.
SHERMAN, speaking: Yes, Ido.

 60 scene 3 / 1776
JOHN, singing:
Then you should write it, Roger, you.
SHERMAN, speaking: Good heavens, no!
JOHN, singing:
Yes, you, Roger Sherman, you!
SHERMAN: But-~
JOHN: You!
SHERMAN: But-—

GLEE CLus: Connecticut!

John resumes his pacing.
JOHN:
Mr. Livingston, maybe you should write it.
You have many friends, and you’re a diplomat.

 SCENE3 / 1776 61
FRANKLIN, speaking; Oh, that word!
JOHN, singing:
Whereas, if I’m the one to do it, They'll run their quill pens through it.

Slowly, all eyes turn to Jefferson.
JEFFERSON:
Mr. Adams!
Leave me Alone!!!
The Glee Club sings a “La-la” theme, under.
Joun, speaking firmly: Mr. Jefferson—
JEFFERSON, speaking:
Mr. Adams, I beg you! I’ve not seen my wife these six months!
JOHN, quoting:
“.. and we solemnly declare we will preserve our liberties, being with one mind resolved to die free men-~—rather than to live slaves!”
The Glee Club stops to listen.
Thomas Jefferson, on the “Necessity of Taking Up Arms,” seventeen seventy-five, magnificent! You write ten times better than any man in the Con- gress—-including me! For a man of only thirty-three years you possess a happy taient for composition and a remarkable felicity of expression, Now! Will you bea patriot? Or alover?
JEFFERSON: A lover!
JOHN: No!

 SCENE3 / 1776 63
JEFFERSON, singing: - But Iburn, Mr. A.!
JOHN:

Everything stops.
JEFFERSON, speaking: You?
SHERMAN: You do?

JEFFERSON, six feet three:
Who will make me, Mr, A,?

 Joun, speaking:
By-—by physical force if necessary! It’s your duty
—your duty, dammit!!
JEFFERSON, singing: Mr. Adams!
Damn you, Mr. Adams!
You're obnoxious and disliked, That cannot be denied.
This is agreed to by all.
GLEE CLUB: Lovely bride!
JEFFERSON:
Oh, Mr. Adams, you are driving me... to Homicide!!
GLEE CLUB; Homicide! Homicide!
JOHN, roaring:
Quiet!! [He is furious.] The choice is yours, Mr. Jefferson! [He thrusts a large quill pen into Jeffer- son’s hand; evenly:| Do—as—-you—like—with— it.

JOHN: Yes!
JEFFERSON: How?

 GLEE CLUuB, gleefully:
We may see mur-der yet!!
SCENE3 /{ 1776 65
John goes, followed by the others.
Jefferson, alone, studies the pen for a moment,
then turns and heads for his lodgings, still regard- ing the pen as he goes.

 SCENE 4
Jefferson’s room, above High Street, It is spare and unaffected, like the man, with a desk, a cupboard, a chair, a couch, and a music stand; a violin sits on the desk,
Jefferson mounts the steps and enters his apart- ment. He takes another look at the pen and throws it onto the desk angrily.
JEFFERSON:
Damn the man! [He removes his coat; then he catches sight of the pen again.| GOD damn the man! [Then, resigned, he sits at the desk and writes a few words, Suddenly he crumples the page and throws it on the floor. He writes some more; but again he crumples the paper and throws it on the floor. Now, merely thinking some unacceptable words, he crumples still another sheet, this one blank. Discouraged, he sits back, picks up his violin to play.}
Meanwhile, John and Franklin have appeared out- side and now enter. Franklin heads for the couch and stretches out, closing his eyes.
JOHN:
Jefferson, are y’finished?
There is no answer.
You’ve had a whole week, man. Is it done? Can I see it?
Jefferson points to all the crumpled paper on the floor. John picks one at random and, flattening it out, reads it,

 SCENE 4 / 1776 ‘67
JOHN:
“There comes a time in the lives of men when it becomes necessary to advance from that subordina- tion in which they have hitherto remained—” this is terrible. [Looking up.] Where’s the rest of it?
Again Jefferson points to the floor.
Do you mean to say it’s not finished?
JEFFERSON:
No, sir-—-I mean to say it’s not begun.
JOHN:
Good God! A whole week! The entire earth was created in a weck!
JEFFERSON, fed up, turning to John:
Some day you must tel me how you did it.
JOHN:
Disgusting! Look at him, Franklin—Virginia’s most famous lover—~
JEFFERSON:
Virginia abstains,
JOHN:
Cheer up, Jefferson, get out of the dumps. It'l come out right, I promise you. Now get back to work. Franklin, tel him to get to work.
JEFFERSON:
He’s asleep.
Outside, a cloaked woman appears. She stops, looks around, then sees the door and enters. It is Martha, Jefferson’s wife, a lovely girl of twenty- seven.
FRANKLIN, sitting bolt upright on the couch: View-hal-loo, and whose-little-girl are you?

scene4 / 1776
But Jefferson and Martha are suddenly oblivious to everything but each other as they meet and em- brace. They kiss, and kiss, and will continue kissing throughout the remainder of the scene.
 JouN:
His wife—{he studies them]—I1 hope.
JOHN:
Because Isent for her.
FRANKLIN: Y’ what?
JOHN: to me that the sooner his prob- It simply occurred
lem was solved, the sooner our problem was solved.
FRANKLIN:
Good thinking, John, good thinking!
No reaction. Adams—John Adams! Nothing.
And Dr, Franklin. Nothing.
Inventor of the stovel!! No luck.
No reaction,
She is your wife, isn’t she?
John, who isshe?
FRANKLIN, his eyes never leaving them: What makes y’think so?
Joun, stepping forward:
Madame, may Ipresent mysclf? John Adams,
Jefferson, would you kindly present me to your wife?

 SCENE4 / 1776 69
FRANKLIN:
Of course she is—look how they fit! [Starting for the door:] Come along, John, come along.
JOHN:
Come along where? There’s work to be done!
FRANKLIN, with a look back over his shoulder: Heh! Obviously!
Outside, on the street.
JOHN:
Good God! Y’mean they— They’re going to—
[He stops.] In the middle of the afternoon?
FRANKLIN:
Not everybody’s from Boston, John. [He takes John’s arm and leads him aside. John keeps look- ing back, unabie to get over it.|
JOHN: Incredible,
FRANKLIN:
Well—good night, John.
JOHN:
Have y’eaten, Franklin?
FRANKLIN:
Not yet, but-—
JouN:

JOHN: Oh.

JOHN:

Incredible.
Music begins.
Oh, Abigail—
Abigail appears, as before.
ABIGAIL;
Are you, John? Then as long as you were sending
for wives, why didn’t you send for your own?
JouN:
Don’t-be unreasonable, Abigail.
ABIGAIL:

Franklin goes, It has grown dark, John stands for a moment, lost in thought. Then he turns and looks up at the lighted window, just as Jefferson’s violin is heard playing a lush arpeggio. An instant later the light goes out.

 ABIGAIL:
That Iplay at cards badly?
JOHN:
A compliment!
ABIGAIL:
That my posture iscrooked?
JOHN:
An endearment!
ABIGAIL:
That Iread, write, and think too much?
JOHN:
An irony!
ABIGAIL:
That Iam pigeon-toed?
JOHN:
Ah, well, there you have me, Abby—I’m afraid you are pigcon-tocd, [Smiling:} Come to Philadel- phia, Abigail—please come.
ABIGAIL:
Thank you, John, J do want to. But you know it’s
:not possible now. The children have the meastes.
JOHN:
Yes, so you wrote—Tom and litle Abby.
ABIGAIL:
Only now it’s Quincy and Charles. And it appears the farm here in Braintree is failing, John—the chickens and gcesc have al died and the apples never survived the late frost. How do you s’pose shemanaged togetaway?
JONN, with a glance to the shuttered window: The winters are softer in Virginia.

ABIGAIL:

JOHN:
Fit for Virginians, madame, but pale, puny things beside New England girls!
ABIGAIL, pleased:
John! Ithank you for that.
A pause.
JOHN:
How goes itwith you, Abigail?
ABIGAIL:
Not well, John—-not at al well.
She sings:
T live like a nun in a cloister, Solitary, celibate, Ihate it. {And you, John?)
JOHN, singing: Hm!
Ilivelikeamonk inanabbey, Ditto, ditto, Ihate it.
ABIGAIL:

JOHN:

And is my fav’rite lover's pillo’ stil firm and fair?
ABIGAIL:
What was there, John! Stillinthere, John!
Come scon as you can to my cloister, I’ve forgotten the feel of your hand.

JOHN:
Soon, Madame, we shall walk In Cupid’s grove to- gether...
JOHN AND ABIGAIL:
And we'll fondly survey that promised land! Till then, til then,
Iam, as Jever was, and ever shall be, Yours...
Yours...
Yours...
Yours... Yours...
ABIGAIL, beating him to it: Saltpetre, John! [And she goes.]
John smiles, Now the daylight returns; it’s the next morning. Franklin enters,
FRANKLIN:
Sorry to be late, John—I was up til all hours, Have y’been here long?
JOHN:
Not long.
FRANKLIN:
And what’re y’doing out here? I expected you’d be up there cracking the whip.
JOHN:
The shutters are stil closed.
FRANKLIN:
My word, so they are! Well, as the French say—
JOHN:
Oh, please, Franklin! Spare me your bawdy mind first thing in the morning!
They regard the closed shutters. Dare we call?

a ———————
 Your voice ismore picrcing.
Joun—he starts, then hesitates: This ispositively indecent!
FRANKLIN:
Oh, John, they’re young and they’re in love.
JOHN:
Not them, Franklin—us! Standing out here—{he gestures vaguely at the shuttered room|—waiting for them to—I mean, what will people think?
FRANKLIN;
Don’t worry, John. The history books will clean jt
up.
JOHN:
It doesn’t matter. 1 won’t appear in the history books, anyway—only you. |He thinks about it.} Franklin did this, Franklin did that, Franklin did some other damned thing. Franklin smote the ground, and out sprang George Washington, fully grown and on his horse. Franklin then electrified him with his miraculous lightning rod, and the three of them—-Franklin, Washington, and the horse— conducted the entire Revolution all by themselves.
A pause.
FRANKLIN; 1like it!
Now.the shutter opens and Martha appears, dressed and radiant. She is humming a tune.
Look at her, John——just loox at her!
74 scENE4 / 1776
FRANKLIN:
A Congressman dares anything. Go ahead.
JOHN: Me?
FRANKLIN:

 Joun, hypnotized: Tam.
FRANKLIN:
She’s even more magnificent than I remember! Of course, we didn’t see much of her front last night. [Calling:] Good morrow, madame!
She looks down at him blankly.
JOHN:
Good morrow!
MARTHA:
Is it the habit in Philadelphia for strangers to shout at ladies from the street?
FRANKLIN:
Not at al, madame, but we’re not—
MARTHA:
And from men of your age it is not only unseemly, it’s unsightly.
JOHN:
Excuse me, madame, but we met last evening,
MARTHA:
I spoke to no one last evening.
FRANKLIN:
Indeed you did not, madame, but nevertheless we presented ourselves. This is Mr. John Adams and I am Dr. Franklin. [As she stares at them, dum- founded.] Inventor of the stove?
MaRTHA:
Oh, please, I know your names very well. But you say you presented yourselves?
FRANKLY, smiling:
It’s of no matter, Your thoughts were well taken elsewhere,
SCENE4 / 1776 75

 FRANKLIN:
Shall we start over? Please join us, madame.
MARTHA:
Yes, of course, [She disappears from the window.]
FRANKLIN:
No wonder the man couldn't write. Who could
think of independence, married to her?
She appears, smiling. MARTHA:
FRANKLIN, smiling back:
Certainly the greatest within earshot, anyway.
MARTHA:
I am not an idle flatterer, Dr. Franklin. My hus-
band admires you both greatly. FRANKLIN:
FRANKLIN:
Yes, John, we do. Tell us about yourself, madame;
76 scene4 / 1776
I beg you to forgive me. It is indeed an honor meeting the two greatest men in America.
JoHN~—finally; the bull in the china shop:
Did you sleep well, madame? [Franklin nudges him with his elbow.] I mean, did you lie comfortably? Oh, damn! Y’know what Imean!
MartTua, turning to the room for amoment: My husband isnot yet up.
Then we are doubly flattered, for. we admire very much that which your husband admires.
A pause as ‘they regard each other warmly. They have hit it off.

FRANKLIN:
Ah. Martha, He might at least have told us that. I'm afraid your husband doesn’t say very much.
JOHN; :
He’s the most silent man in Congress, I’ve never heard him utter three sentences together,
FRANKLIN:
Not everyone’s a talker, John.
MARTHA:
It’s true, you know. [She turns to look at the win- dow.] Tom isnot—a talker.
She sings.
Oh, he never speaks his passions, He never speaks his views. Whereas other men speak volumes, The man I love is mute.
In truth
Ican’t recall
Being woo'd with words Atall.
Even now...
Music continues under.
JOHN, speaking:

JOHN:

FRANKLIN:

MAarTHA—she looks at them for a moment, then leans in und sings, confidentially:

He tucks itright under his chin,
And he bows,
Oh, he bows,
For he knows,
Yes, he knows, that it’s...
Heigh, heigh, heigh diddic-diddle, ’Twixt my heart, Tom, and his fiddle, My strings arc unstrung. Heigh-hcigh-heigh-heigh-igh-igh ... Heigh—1 am undone!
John and Franklin look at one another, not at all sure if she’s putting them on or not.
FRANKLIN, speaking:

MARTHA:
I hear his violin,
And 1 get that fecling within, And Isigh...
Oh, Isigh...
He draws near,
Very near, and it’s...
Heigh, heigh, heigh diddle-diddlc, and... Good-bye to the fiddle!
My strings are unstrung.

Heigh-heigh-heigh-heigh-igh-igh ... Heigh—I’m always undone!
FRANKLIN, speaking:
That settles it, John, we’re taking up the violin!
JOHN, to Martha:
Very well, madame, you’ve got us playing the violin! What happens next?
MARTHA:
Next, Mr. Adams?
JOHN:
Yes! What does Tom do now?
MartTHAa, demurely:
Why, just what you’d expect.
John and Franklin exchange expectant looks.
We dance!
JOHN AND FRANKLIN, together and to each other: Dance?
FRANKLIN: Incredible!
MARTHA:
One-two-three, one-two-three!
And in an instant she has swept Franklin off into an energetic waltz, John watches them jor a mo- ment, still trying to understand,
JOHN:
Who’s playing the violin?
FRANKLIN:
Oh, John—-really!
And Martha leaves Franklin ‘to begin waltzing with

JOHN:
Franklin, look! He’s written something—he’s done it! (He dashes after them, snatches the paper off the bow, and comes back to Franklin, delighted, and reads it.] “Dear Mr. Adams: I am taking my wife back to bed. Kindly go away. Y’r ob’d’t, T. Jeffer- son.”
FRANKLIN:
What, again?
JouNn: Incredible!
FRANKLIN:
Perhaps I’m the one who should’ve written the declaration, after al. At my age there’s little doubt that the pen is mightier than the sword,
He sings:
For it’s
Heigh, heigh, heigh diddle-diddle.
Enviously:
And God bless the man who can fiddle...
JOHN, ever the old warhorse: An independency!
JOHN AND FRANKLIN, regaining their energy: Heigh-heigh-heigh-heig-igh-igh. Yata-ta-ta-tah! ;

Hancock sits at the President's table, but he is occupied reading the Philadelphia Gazette, his feet up on the desk; one group of Congressmen-—— Morris, Read, Wilson, and Dickinson—sit with their heads together, talking; another group-——Hop- kins, Bartlett, and Sherman-—stands in the rear,
also conversing; Rutledge and Hewes pace back and forth across the length of the Chamber as they talk; McKean stands by the window, cleaning a long rifle; Chase, a large napkin tied around his neck, sits eating a complete meal; Witherspoon is asleep at his desk, his head thrown back, his mouth

JOHN:

 McKgan:
But what good will it do? Y’know Dickinson— he'll never give in! And y’haven’t heard the last
of Rutledge yet, either.
JOHN:
Never mind about them. Your job is George Read. Talk him deaf if you have to, but bring us back Delaware!
McKgzan:
There’s a simpler way. [He holds up his rifle. This'll break the tie! [He goes to talk to Read.]
FRANKLIN:
All right, John, who’s next?
Again they turn to study the board.
THOMSON:

JOHN:
Pennsylvania and Mary-land. I suggest you try to put your own house in order while I take a crack at Old Bacon Face (look at him stuff himself!) Mr. Chase! [He goes to him.] How about it, Chase? When are you coming to your senses?
CHASE, sourly:
Please, Mr. Adams—not while I’m eating!
FRANKLIN, drawing Wilson aside:
Mr. Wilson, it’s time to assert yourself. When you were a judge, how in hell did you ever make a decision?
WILSON:
The decisions I made were al based on legality and precedence. But there is no legality here— and certainly no precedent.

 SCENE 5 / 1776 87
FRANKLIN:
Because it’s a new idea, you clot! We'll be sctting our own precedent!
READ, arguing with McKean:
No, Mr. McKcan—no, no, no/
McKEAaNn:
Damn y’r eyes, Read, y’came into this world screamin’ “no,” and y’re determined to Icave it the same way, y’little worm!
JOHN, with Chase:
The Congress is waiting on you, Chase—Amcri- ca’s waiting—the whole world is waiting! What's that, kidney? [He takes a morsel of food from Chase's plate with his fingers, but Chase slaps his hand and he drops it.]
CHASE:
Leave me alone, Mr. Adams, you’re wasting your time. H I thought we could win this war, I’d be at the front of your ranks. But you must know it’s impossible! You’ve heard General Washing- ton’s dispatches, His army has fallen apart.
JOHN;
Washington’s cxaggerating the situation in order to arouse this torpid Congress into action. Why, as Chairman of the War Commitice 1 can tell you for a fact that the army has never been in better shape! Never have troops been so cheerful! Never have soldicrs been morc resolute! Never have discipline and training been more spirited!
The Courier enters, dusty as ever. John winces. Good God!
The Courier deposits his dispatch on Thomson's

 HANCOCK:
May we have your ears, gentlemen? Mr. Thom- son has a dispatch.
THOMSON, ringing his bell:
From the Commander, Army of the United Colo- nies; in New York, dispatch number one thousand, one hundred and fifty-seven. “To the honorable Congress, John Hancock, President. Dear Sir: It is with the utmost despair that I must report to you the confusion and disorder that reign in every department—”
MCNAIR:
Sweet Jesus!
THOMSON;
“The Continental soldier is as nothing ever seen in this, or any other, century; he is a misfit, igno- rant of hygiene, destructive, disorderly and totally disrespectful of rank, Only this last is understand- able as there is an incredible reek of stupidity amongst the officers. The situation is most des- perate at the New Jersey Training Ground in New Brunswick where every able-bodied whore—whore —in the Colonies has assembled. There are con- stant reports of drunkenness, desertion, foul lan- guage, naked bathing in the Raritan River, and an epidemic of the French disease. I have declared the town ‘off-limits’ to al military personnel—with the exception of officers. I beseech the Congress to dispatch the War Committee to this place in

McKEan:
Och! The man would depress ahyena!
HANCOCK:
Well, Mr. Adams, you’re Chairman of the War Committee. Do y’feel up to whoring, drinking, deserting, and New Brunswick?
WITHERSPOON:
There must be some mistake, I have an aunt who lives in New Brunswick!
Laughter.
DICKINSON:
You must tel her to keep up the good work!
Laughter.
Come, come, Mr. Adams, you must see that it’s ‘hopeless. Let us recall General Washington and disband the Continental Army before we are over-
whelmed.
JOHN:
Oh, yes, the English would like that, wouldn’t they?
DICKINSON:
Why not ask them yourself? They ought to be here
-any minute. Laughter.
RUTLEDGE;
And when they hang you, Mr. Adams, I hope you will put in a good word for the rest of us.
A distressed silence,

 CHASE:

CHASE:

 SCENE§ / 1776 91
JOHN:
Mr, President, the War Committee will heed Gen- eral Washington’s request! A party consisting of Mr. Chase, Dr. Franklin, and myself will leave immediately.
HANCOCK;
Is that satisfactory with you, Dr. Franklin?
All eyes turn to Franklin, who is asleep again. Hopkins nudges him,
JOHN:
Wake up, Franklin, you’re going to New Bruns- wick!
FRANKLIN:
Like hell Iam. What for?
Hopkin:
The whoring and the drinking.
FRANKLIN, perking up:
Why didn’t you say so?
They start out. John driving them ahead of him like a sergeant-major.
JOHN:
Come on, Chase, move all that lard! We’ve no time to lose! Left-right, left-right, left-right—!
And they are gone.
The other liberals then go, leaving only the con-
servatives, Dickinson looks around, then rises.
DickINsoN:
Mr. MeNair, al this talk of independence has left a certain foulness in the air.
Laughter from the conservatives.
My friends and I would appreciate it if you could open some windows.

 McNair:
What about the flies?
DIcKINSON, smiling:
The windows, Mr. McNair.
Oh, say, do you see what I see? Congress sitting here in sweet serenity. Icould cheer.
The reason’s clear:
For the first time in a year
Adams isn’there!
And, look!
The sun is in the sky,
The breeze isblowing by,
And there’s not a single fly!
Oh, sing Hosanna, Hosanna!
CONSERVATIVES: Hosanna, Hosanna!
DICKINSON:

92 scENE5 / 1776
As McNair goes to the windows, the clock strikes four. Dickinson takes a deep breath, surveys the Chamber, then sings.

 SCENE5 / 1776 93
CONSERVATIVES:
Come sing Hosanna, Hosanna!
DICKINSON:
In our breeding and our manner...
CONSERVATIVES:
... Weare cool!
DICKINSON:

CONSERVATIVES:
Come sing Hosanna, Hosanna!
DICKINSON:
Emblazoned on our banner Is “Keep Cool!”
The Minuet is led by Dickinson and Rutledge, as the conservatives dance. During this the Courier re-enters and deposits his dispatch, as usual, on Thomson’s desk, McNair goes to him, offers him a rum, and he stays.
CONSERVATIVES: To the right,
Ever to the right,
The cool, cool conservative men~-—-Rutledge, Wil- son, Read, Morris, Hall, Livingston, and Hewes among them-—elegantly prepare to dance.

 Never to the left, Forever to the right.
DICKINSON:

THOMSON, singing:

94 scene5 /{ 1776
Music stops, but the Minuet continues silently. Thomson speaks.
A short pause; then music begins again and the song continues as if nothing had happened.
From the Commander, Army of the United Colo- nies; in New York, dispatch number one thousand, one hundred and fifty-eight. “To the honorable Congress, John Hancock, President. Dear Sir: I awoke this morning to find that Gen. Howe has landed twenty-five thousand British regulars and Hessian mercenaries on Staten Island and that the
fleet, under the command of his brother, Admiral Lord Howe, controls not only the. Hudson and East Rivers, but New York Harbour, which now looks like al of London afloat, I can no longer, in good conscience, withhold from the Congress my certainty that the British’ military object at this
time is Philadelphia. Happy should I be if I could see the means of preventing them, but at present Iconfess I do not. Oh, how I wish I had never seen the Continental Army. I would have done better to retire to the back country and live in a
wigwam. Y’r ob’d’t— Drum roll.
—G. Washington.”

 SCENE5 / 1776 95
CONSERVATIVES, singing:
What we do, we do rationally.
DICKINSON:
We never ever go off half cocked, not we.
CONSERVATIVES: Why begin,
Till we know that we can win? And ifwe cannot win,
Why bother to begin?
RUTLEDGE:
We say this game’s not of our choosing, Why should we risk losing?
CONSERVATIVE:
We cool, cool men.
DICKINSON, speaking, stildancing:
Mr. Hancock, you’re a man of property—one of us, Why don’t you join us in our minuet? Why do you persist in dancing with John Adams? Good Lord, sir, you don’t even like him!
HANCOCK, singing: That istrue,
He annoys-me quite a lot, But stil I'd rather trot
To Mr. Adams’ new gavotte.
HANCOCK:
Traitors to what, Mr. Dickinson—the British
Crown? Or the British Aalf-crown? Fortunately,
DICKINSON, speaking, continuing to dance:
But why? For personal glory? For a place in his- tory? Be careful, sir. History will brand him and his followers as traitors!

 DICKINSON:
Perhaps not, but don’t forget that most men with
nothing would rather protect the possibility of be- coming rich than face the reality of being poor. And that is why they will follow us...
CONSERVATIVES:
... To the right,
Ever to the right, Never to the left, Forever to the right. Where there’s gold,
A market that will hold, Tradition that is old,

CouRIER:

McNair:
Yeah, well, what’s the Army know? [He pours the the Courier another drink, pours himself and the Leather Apron a pair, selects one of Hancock’s good clay pipes, lights it, then bangs with the gavel.] Sit down, gentlemen. The Chair rules it’s

They turn and go, leaving only McNair, the Leather Apron, and the Courier in the Chamber. They are sient for a moment,

 SCENE6
An anteroom off the main Congressional Chamber. At rise, the stage remains dark from the previ- ous scene as the sounds of Congress in session are
heard: first, Thomson's bell for attention.
HANCOCK:
The Secretary will now read the report of the Declaration Committee, Mr. Thomson.
THOMSON:
“A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America in General Congress as- sembled,”
Lights come up on the anteroom. It is deserted save for Jefferson,.who stands by the door into the Chamber, holding it ajar so he can listen to Thom- son read his Declaration.
“When in the Course of Human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent

Jefferson, having heard a sound offstage, closes
the door, silencing Thomson's voice. John and i Franklin enter from the wings, wearing capes and
hats.

SCENE 7
The Chamber. Congress is in session—Hancock, Bartlett, Hopkins, Sherman, Morris, Livingston, Witherspoon, Dickinson, Wilson, McKean, Read, Hewes, Rutledge, and Hall being present—and now John, Franklin, and Jefferson take their places, this action continuing from the previous scene, as Thomson completes his reading of the Declaration. The calendar on the wall now reads: “JUNE 28.”
«__and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, con- tract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do al other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Dec- laration we mutually pledge to each other our
Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.”
Finished, he looks up. Nobody moves, nobody speaks, nobody reacts; the silence is compiete and
HANCOCK, finally:
Very well. Thank you, Mr. Thomson. The Con- gress has heard the report of the Declaration Com- mittee. Are there any who wish to offer amend- ments, deletions, or alterations to the Declaration?
Suddenly every hand but John’s, Franklin's, Jef- ferson’s, and Hopkins’ shoots up.

 I’ve got one! Over here! {Et cetera.]
MCKEAN:
Mr. Jefferson, it’s abonny paper y’ve written, but
somewhere in it y’ve mentioned “Scottish and for- eign mercenaries sent t’destroy us.” Scottish, Tom?
JOHN:
MCKEAN:
Och, it was more likely Germans wearin’ kilts to disguise their bein’ there. I ask y'to remove the word and avoid givin’ offense to a good people.
THOMSON:
Mr. Jefferson?
Jefferson nods and Thomson scratches his quill pen through the word. The many hands go up again.
HANCOCK:
The Reverend Witherspoon?
WITHERSPOON:
Mr. Jefferson, nowhere do you mention the Su- preme Being. Certainly this was an oversight, for how could we hope to achieve a victory without His help? Therefore Jmust humbly suggest the following addition to your final sentence: “With a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Provi-
dence.”
It’s in reference to a Highland regiment which stood against us atBoston.
SCENE 7 / 1776 109
Again Thomson looks at Jefferson, who in turn looks at John; the two patriots shrug, then Jeffer-
HANcock, pounding the gavel for order:
Gentlemen, please! McNair, you’d better open the window. Colonel McKean, I saw your hand first.

 HANCOCK:
Mr. Read?
READ:
Among your charges against the King, Mr. Jeffer- son, you accuse him of dépriving us of the bene- fits of trial by jury. This is untrue, sir. In Delaware we have always had trial by jury.
JouHN:
In Massachusetts we have not.
READ:Oh. Then I suggest that the words “in many cases” be added.
THOMSON:
Mr. Jefferson?
McKEaNn: brilliant! I s’pose every “In many cases!”—-och,

son turns back to Thomson and nods; the phrase isadded. More hands.
HANCOCK, pounding the gavel:
Mr. Read, Colonel McKean—-that’s enough!
The hands are raised, this time Hopkins’ among them.
And again Jefferson nods; the words are added,

 SCENE7 / 1776 111
HOPKINS:
No objections, Johnny, I’m just trying to get 2
drink.
HANCOCK:
Ishould’ve known. McNair, gethim arum.
Again the hands go up.
McNair crosses to the wall calendar and removes
a leaf, uncovering “June 29.”
Mr. Bartlett?
BARTLETT:
Mr. Jefferson, {beg you to remember that we stil have friends in England. I see no purpose in an- tagonizing tlicm with such phrases as “unfeeling brethren” and “cnemics in war.” Our quarrel is with the British King, not the British people.
JOHN:
Be sensible, Bartlett. Remove those phrases, and the entire paragraph becomes meaninglcss. And it so happens it’s among the most stirring and poetic of any passage in the entire document. [He picks up the Declaration from Thomson's desk, prepar- ing to read}
BARTLETT: .
We're a Congress, Mr. Adams, not a literary so- ciety. I ask that the entire paragraph be stricken.
THOMSON:
Mr. Jefferson?
JOHN:
speak up for your own work?
Good God, Jefferson! Don’t you ever intend to
And again, after some thought this time, and with some sadness, Jefferson nods.

 JEFFERSON:
I had hoped that the work would speak for itsclf,
Thomson scratches out the paragraph.
McNair;
Mr. Hancock.
HANCOCK:
What isit,Mr. McNair?
McNAIR:
I can’t say I’m very fond of the United States of Amcrica as a name for a new country.
HANCOCK:
I don’t care what you’re fond of, Mr. McNair, You're not a member of this Congress! Mr. Sher- man?
SHERMAN, coffee in hand, as usual:
Brother Jefferson, 1 noted at least two distinct and direct references to the British Parliament in your Declaration. Do you think it’s wise to alienate that august body in light of our contention that they
-have never had any direct authority over us any- way?
JOHN:
This is a revolution, dammit! We're going to have to offend somebody!
FRANKLIN;
John. [He leads John downstage as the debate in the Chamber continues silently behind them.] John, you'll have an attack of apoplexy if you're not careful. “
JOHN:
Have you heard what they’re doing to it? Have you heard?
112 SCENE7 / 1776

 SCENE7 / 1776 , 113
FRANKLIN:
Yes, John, I’ve heard, but-—
JOHN:
And so far it’s only been our friends? Can you imagine what our enemies will do?
Hancock:
The word “Parliament” will be removed wherever it occurs.
JOHN;
They won't be satisfied until they remove one of the Fs from Jefferson’s name.
FRANKLIN:
Courage, John! It won’t last much longer.
They start back toward their seats as the hands go up again,
And again McNair goes to the calendar and removes another page; itnow reads; “JUNE 30.”
HANCOCK:
Mr. Dickinson?
DICKINSON:
Mr. Jefferson, I have very litle interest in your paper, as there is no doubt in my mind that we have al but heard the fast of it, But I am curious about one thing: why do you refer to King George as a tyrant?
JEFFERSON:
Because he is a tyrant.
DICKINSON:
I remind you, Mr. Jefferson, that this “tyrant” is stilyour King.
JBFFERSON:
When a king becomes a tyrant he thereby breaks the contract binding his subjects to him.

 DICKINSON: How so?
JEFFERSON:
By taking away their rights.
DICKINSON:
Rights that came from him in the first place.
JEFFERSON:
All except one—the right to be free comes from
nature.
DICKINSON:
Mr. Wilson, do we in Pennsylvania consider King
George atyrant?
WILSON:

DICKINSON:
There you are, Mr. Jefferson. Your Declaration does not speak for us al. I demand the word “tyrant” be removed!
Thomson begins scratching itout.
JEFFERSON:
Just a moment, Mr. Thomson, I do not consent. The King is a tyrant whether we say so or not. We might as well say so.
THOMSON:
But Ialready scratched itout.
JEFFERSON, forcefuliy:
Then scratch itback in!
A surprised silence.

JOHN:
Good God! Fishing rights! How long is this pid- dling to go on? We have been sitting here for three full days. We have endured, by my count, eighty- five separate changes and the removal of close to four hundred words. Would you whip it and beat it til you break its spirit? I tel you this document is a masterful expression of the American mind!
There isasilence.
HANCOCK:
If there are no more changes, then, I can assume that the report of the Declaration Committee has been-—.
RUTLEDGE, deliberately:

RUTLEDGE;
I wonder if we could prevail upon Mr. Thomson to read again a small portion of Mr. Jefferson’s

Everyone throws up his hands in disgust and im- patience.

 HANCOCK;

RUTLEDGE:
That will suffice, Mr. Thomson, I thank you. Mr.
Jefferson, I can’t quite make out what it is you're talkin’ about.
JEFFERSON:
Slavery, Mr. Rutledge.
RUTLEDGE:
Ah, yes. You're referrin’ to us as slaves of the King.
JEFFERSON:
No, sir, I’m referring to our slaves. Black slaves.
RUTLEDGE:
Ah! Black slaves. Why didn’t you say so, sir? Were you tryin’ to hide your meanin’?

Here it is. (He clears his throat and reads.} “He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, in the persons of a distant people who never of- fended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere. Determined to keep open a market where men should be bought and sold, he has prostituted-—~”

 JEFFERSON: Ifyou like.
RUTLEDGE:
I don’t like at al, Mr. Jefferson. To us in South Carolina, black slavery is our peculiar institution and a cherished way of life.
JEFFERSON:
Nevertheless, we must abolish it. Nothing is more certainly written in the Book of Fate than that this people shall be free.
RUTLEDGE:
[ am not concerned with the Book of Fate right now, sir. fam more concerned with what’s written in your litle paper there.
JOHN:
That “little paper there” deals with freedom for Amcricans!
RUTLEDGE:
Oh, really! Mr. Adams is now callin’ our black slaves Americans, Arc-they-now?
JOHN:
They are! They’re people and they're here—if there is any requirement, I’ve never heard of it.
RUTLEDGE:
They are here, yes, but they are not people, sir, they are property.
JEFFERSON:
No, sir! They are pcople who are being treated as property. 1 tel you the rights of human nature are deeply wounded by this infamous practice!

 RUTLEDGE, shouting:
Then see to your own wounds, Mr. Jefferson, for you are a—practitioner, are you not?
JEFFERSON:

There is a silence. Then Chase bursts into the Chamber.

He runs down as the news is greeted with less enthusiasm than expected, and he sees the glum faces.
What’s wrong? Ithought—
Wilson, Read, Livingston, and Morris follow him out. Chase joins the ranks of the depressed as Thomson moves Maryland into the “Yea” column.

JOHN: Roger!
SHERMAN:

WITHERSPOON:
I’m sorry, John.
And they go.
John looks around, stunned by the defection.
And suppose they change their minds—can we get Delaware without Rodney?

 FRANKLIN:
We've no other choice, John. The slavery clause
has to go.
JOHN:
Franklin, what are y’saying?
FRANKLIN:
It’s a luxury we can’t afford.
JOHN:
FRANKLIN;

slavery society on this continent!

These men, no matter how much we disagree with them, arc not ribbon clerks to be ordered about; they’re proud, accomplishcd men, the cream of their colonies—-and whether you like it or not, they and the people they represent will be a part of the new country you’d hope to create! Either start fearning how to live with them or pack up and go home—but in any case, stop acting like a Boston fishwife!

And he leaves John alone, returning upstage to join Jefferson.
John turns and comes downstage.
JOHN:
Good God, what’s happened to me? John Adams, the great John Adams, Wise Man of the East— what have I come to? My law practice down the the pipe, my farm mortgaged to the hilt—at a stage inlife when other men prosper I’m reduced to living in Philadelphia.
Abigail appears, as before.
Oh, Abigail, what am I going to do?
ABIGAIL:
Do, John?
JOHN:
Ineed your help.
ABIGAIL:
You don’t usually ask my advice.
JOHN;
Yes—well, there doesn’t appear to be anyone else right now. -
ABIGAIL, sighing:
Very well, John, what is it?
ABIGAIL:
Nonsense, John. .
JOHN:
The entire South has walked out of this Congress, George Washington is on the verge of total anni-
hilation, the precious cause for which I’ve labored these several years has come to nothing, and it
seems—[a pause}-—it seems Iam obnoxious and disliked.

 JOHN:
ABIGAIL:
Foolishness, John.
JOHN:
That Iam pig-headed.
He smiles; a pause.
JOHN:
ABIGAIL:
Inever asked for more. After all, Iam Mrs, John
Adams—that’s quite a lot for one lifetime.
Joun, bitterly: Is it, Abby?
ABIGAIL:
Think of it, John! To be married to the man who is always first in line to be hanged!
JOHN:
That Jam unwilling to face reality.
Has it been any kind of a life for you, Abby? God knows Ihaven’t given you much,
Yes. The ag-i-ta-tor. [Turning to her:] Why, Abby? You must tell me what it is! I’ve always been dis- satisfied, Iknow that; but lately I find that I reek of discontentment! It fils my throat and floods my brain, and sometimes—sometimes I fear that there is no longer a dream, but only the discontentment.
ABIGAIL:
Oh, John, can you really know so little about yourself? And can you think so litle of me that you'd believe I married the man you’ve described?
126 scene7 / 1776
ABIGAIL, smiling:
Ah, well, there you have me, John. I'm afraid you are pig-headed.

 Have you forgotten what you used to say to me? J haven't. “Commitment, Abby—commitment! There are only two creatures of value on the face of this earth: those with a commitment, and those who require the commitment of others.” [4 pause.] Do you remember, John?
JOHN, nodding: I remember.
McNair enters, carrying two gaily beribboned kegs, and thumps them down in front of John.
MCNAIR:
Mr. Adams-—~-
JOHN: What?
MCNAIR:
These’re for you.
JOHN:
Just a minute—what are they? What’s in them? Who sent them?
Music in, glissando.

Compliments of the Concord Ladies’ Coffee Club, And the Sisterhood of the Truro Synagogue,
And the Friday Evening Baptist Sewing Circle, And the Holy Christian Sisters of Saint Clare— All for you, John!

MCNAIR:
Pin? What sort of pin?

Get out of your chair! Tomorrow ishere. Tos late,
Too late to despair!

JouN, considering:
No, you’re the President of Congress, You're a fair man, Hancock-——stay that way.
The Courier enters and stops short as he comes face to face with John, who takes his dispatch and crosses up to Thomson's desk, where he hands it to the Secretary.

 He reads, singing.
JIANCOCK:
Are y’hungry, John?
JOHN:
No, Ithink Illstay.
HANCOCK;
“Is anybody there? Does anybody care?”
He drops the dispatch.
Does anybody see what Isee?
scene 7 / 1776
Tell me, Mr. Thomson, out of curiosity, do you stand with Mr. Dickinson, or do you stand with me?
Drum roll; then it rans down as Thomson, unable to read the signature, rises and goes, thoroughly discouraged.
It is growing dark outside. Hancock stands by the door, watching John, concerned,
G’night, then. [He goes.]
John looks around the Chamber, then goes to Thomson’s desk and picks up the dispatch.
THOMSON, holding up the dispatch:
I stand with the General. Lately—I’ve had the oddest feeling that he’s been—writing to me.

Again, nothing.

HALL, speaking:
John turns and discovers the Georgia delegate standing by the door, in the shadows.
Yes, Mr. Adams, Ido.
He walks to the tally board and moves the name of Georgia from the “Nay” to the “Yea” column. The two men regard each other for a moment.
It has been growing light outside and now the clock, offstage, chimes ten and the. men of the Congress return silently, in single file, each with his own private thoughts, McKean supporting Rod- ney at the end.
Then Hancock pounds the gavel.
Dr. Hall, Ididn’t know anyone was-—
I'm sorry if 1 startled you. I couldn’t sleep. In try- ing to resolve my dilemma I remembered some- thing I’d once read—“that a representative owes the People not only his industry, but his judgment, and he betrays them if he sacrifices it to their opinion.” [He smiles.) It was written by Edmund Burke, a member of the British Parliament.
HANCOCK: ;
Very well. The Congress will now vote on Vir- ginia’s resolution on independence. [To Rodney:]

JOHN:

RUTLEDGE:

JOHN:
If we did that we’d be guilty of what we ourselves are rebelling against.
RUTLEDGE:

DICKINSON:
Mr. President, Pennsylvania regrets al of the in- convenience that such distinguished men as Adams, Franklin, and Jefferson were put to just now. They might have kept their document intact, for al the difference it will make. Mr. President, Pennsyl- vania says—
FRANKLIN:
Just amoment! I ask that the delegation be polled.
DICKINSON:
Dr. Franklin, don’t be absurd!

A poll, Mr. President. It’s a proper request.

All eyes turn to Wilson.
FRANKLIN:
There it is, Mr. Wilson, it’s up to you now—the whole question of American independence rests squarely on your shoulders. An entirely new na- tion, Mr. Wilson, waiting to be born or to die in birth, al on your say-so. Which will it be, Mr. Wilson? Every map-maker in the world is waiting for your decision!
DICKINSON:
Come now, James, nothing has changed. We mustn’t let Dr. Franklin create one of his confu- sions. The question isclear.
FRANKLIN:
Most questions are clear when someone else has to decide them.
JOHN, quietly, turning the screw:
It would be a pity for a man who handed down hundreds of wise decisions from the bench to be remembered only for the one unwise decision he made i:Congress.
DICKINSON:
James, you’re keeping everybody waiting. The Secretary has called for your vote.

WILSON, to Dickinson:
Please don’t push me, John, Iknow what you want me to do. But Mr. Adams is correct about one thing. I’m the one who'll be remembered for it.
DICKINSON:
What do you mean?
WILSON:
I’m different from you, John. I’m different from most of the men here. I don’t want to be remem- bered, Ijust don’t want the responsibility!
DICKINSON:
Yes, well, whether you want it or not, James, there’s no way of avoiding it.
WILSON:
Not necessarily. If I go with them, Til only be one among dozens; no one will ever remember the name of James Wilson. But if I vote with you, Ill be the man who prevented American independ- ence, I’m sorry, John—I just didn’t bargain far that.
DICKINSON:
And is that how new nations are formed—by a nonentity trying to preserve the anonymity he so richly deserves?
FRANKLIN:
Revolutions come into this world like bastard children, Mr. Dickinson-—~half improvised and half compromised, Our side has provided the compro- mise; now Judge Wilson is supplying the rest.

I'l speak to the printer about it later.
HANCOCK:
Very well, gentlemen. [He goes to Thomson's desk
and picks up the quill.] We are about to brave the storm in a skiff made of paper, and how it will end, God only knows. [He signs with a flourish.]
HoPKINsS:
That’s apretty large signature, Johnny.
HANCOCK:
So Fat George in London can read it without his
glasses! Laughter. -
Laughter,
FRANKLIN:
Hancock’s right. This paper is our passport to the
gallows. But there’s no backing out now. If we don’t hang together, we shall most assuredly hang
separately. Laughter.
Laughter.
142 SCENE 7 / 1776
All right, gentlemen, step right up, don’t miss your chance tocommit treason!
McKean, patting his ample middle:
In any case hanging won’t be so bad—one snap and it’l be over-—{snap/]—just like that! But look at Read, there—he’ll be dancing d jig long after I’m gonel

 SCENE7 /{ 1776 143
HANCOcx:
Gentlemen, forgive me if I don’t join in the merri- ment, but if we’re arrested now—my name is still the only one on the damn thing!
More laughter, which subsides slowly as the Courier enters, deposits his dispatch on Thom- son’s desk, and departs, turning to glance at John as he goes.
THOMSON:
From the Commander, Army of the United Colo- nics—{he stops, looks up|—Army of the United States—in New York, dispatch number one thou- sand, two hundred and nine. “To the Hon. Con- grcss, John Hancock, President. Dear Sir: I can now report with some certainty that the eve of battle is near at hand. Toward this end I have or- dered the evacuation of Manhattan and directed our defenses to take up stronger positions on the Brooklyn Heights. At the present time my forces consist entirely of Hasict’s Delaware Militia and Smallwood's Mary-landers, a total of five thousand troops stand against—[he hesitates in horrified
astonishment}—twenty-five thousand of the enemy —and [begin to notice that many of them are lads under fifteen and old men, none of whom could truly be calicd soldicrs. One personal note to Mr. Lewis Morris of New York-—-} must regretfully report that his estates have becn totally destroyed but that I have taken the liberty of transporting Mrs. Morris and cight of the children to Connecti- cut and safety. The four oldcr boys are now en- listed in the Continental Army. As I write these words, the enemy is plainly in sight beyond the river. How it will end only Providence can direct

 Drum roll.
—G. Washington.”
HANCOCK, finally:
Very well, gentlemen. MeNair, go ring the bell.
McNair goes.
Morris, rising: Mr. President!
HANCOCK:
Mr. Morris?
Morris:
To hell with New York-——PIl sign itanyway.
HANCOCK;
Thank you, Mr. Morris. Stephcn, sitdown.
HANCOCK:
Very well, Mr, Thomson—

-—but dear God! what brave men—I shall lose— before this business ends. Y’r ob’d’t—~
There is a silence, during which McNair goes to the calendar and removes the final leaf, revealing: “JULY 4.”
The light outside has dimmed; it is becoming evening,
Hopkins, wha has been standing next to the Declaration on Thomson's desk:
No—I want t’remember each man’s face as he signs.
As each name is called, the signer rises, comes to the Secretary’s desk, signs, then stands to one side. The tolling Liberty Bell begins, offstage.

 THOMSON, inmeasured tones:
New Hampshire, Dr. Josiah Bartiett. Massachusetts, Mr. John Adams.
Rhode Island, Mr. Stephen Hopkins. Connecticut, Mr. Roger Sherman.
New York, Mr. Lewis Morris. .
New Jersey, the Reverend John Witherspoon. Pennsylvania, Dr. Benjamin Franklin,
Delaware, Mr. Caesar Rodney.
Hancock takes the Declaration to the infirm Rod- ney, then returns it to the table.
Mary-land, Mr. Samuel Chase. Virginia, Mr. Thomas Jefferson. North Carolina, Mr. Joseph Hewes. South Carolina, Mr. Edward Rutledge. Georgia, Dr. Lyman Hall.
As the last man signs, the sound of the tolling Lib- erty Bell in the belfry above becomes almost deaf- ening.
Then the scene freezes for a brief instant, and the pose of the familiar Pine-Savage engraving of this occasion has been captured.
A scrim curtain falls, the scene visible through it. Then as the back-light dims and the curtain is lit from the front, it becomes opaque and reveals the lower half of the Declaration, featurintghe signatures.
