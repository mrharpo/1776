# Act 1

### "Overture

INT. SCENE 1

In front of the curtain.

JOHN ADAMS
I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace, that two are called a Jaw firm, and that three or more become a congress, And by God, I have had this Congress! For ten years King George and his Parliament have gulled, cullied, and diddied these Colonies with their illegal taxes— Stamp Acts, Townshend Acts, Sugar Acts, Tea Acts—and when we dared stand up like men they stopped our trade, seized our ships, blockaded our ports, burned our towns, and spilled our blood-— and still this Congress won't grant any of my proposals on Independence even so much as the courtesy of open debate! Good God, what in hell are they waiting for?

The curtain flies up to reveal the Chamber of the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, At rise, Congress is in session, sweltering in the heat of a@premature summer's evening, A large day-by-day wall calendar reads: “MAY 8.”

## May 8
### "Sit Down, John"

CONGRESS
~Sit down, John!
~Sit down, John!
~For God's sake, John Sit down!
~Sit down, John!
~Sit down, John!
~For God's sake, John. Sit down!

VOICES FROM CONGRESS A
~Are you going to open up a window?

CONGRESS A
~Can't we
~Compromise here?

JOHN
~Vote Yes

CONGRESS B
~No, too many
~Flies here!

JOHN
~Vote Yes!

CONGRESS, FULL
~Oh, for God's sake, John, 
~Sit down!

They freeze.

JOHN (roaring)
Good God!! Consider yourselves fortunate that you have John Adams to abuse, for no sane man would tolerate it!

Resuming action

CONGRESS
~John, you're a bore!
~We've heard this before! 
~Now, for God's sake, John, 
~Sit down!

JOHN
~I say, “Vote Yes!”

SOME VOICES
~No!!

JOHN
~Vote Yes!

CONGRESS, FULL
~No!!

JOHN
~Vote for
~Independency!

CONGRESS A
~Someone ought to open up a window!

JOHN
~I say “Vote Yes!”

CONGRESS, FULL
~Sit down, John!

JOHN
~Vote for independency!!!

VOICE
Will someone shut that man up!!

JOHN (speaking)
Never! Never! 

### "Piddle, Twiddle and Resolve"

He storms from the Chamber, coming downstage, and looks to Heaven for guidance

JOHN
Dear God! For one solid year they have been sitting there for one year! Doing nothing!
  
~I do believe you've laid a curse on 
~North America!
~A curse that we here now rehearse in 
~Philadelphia!
~A second Flood, a simple famine, 
~Plagues of locusts-everywhere,
~Or a cataclysmic earthquake,
~I'd accept with some despair.
~But, no, you've sent us Congress— 
~Good God, Sir, was that fair?
  
~I say this with humility in 
~Philadelphia!
~We're your responsibility in 
~Philadelphia!
~If you don't want to see us hanging
~On some far-off British hill,
~If you don't want the voice of independency 
~Forever stil,
~Then, God, Sir, get Thee to it,
~For Congress never will!
  
~You see we
~Piddle, twiddle, and resolve.
~Not one damned thing do we solve. 
~Piddle, twiddle, and resolve. 
~Nothing's ever solved in
~Foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy
~Philadelphia!

From the Chamber, rear, a Congressional voice can be heard.

VOICE
~Someone ought to open up a window!

JOHN
Oh, shut up!

JOHN HANCOCK
I now call the Congress' attention to the petition of Mr. Melchior Meng, who claims twenty dollars' compensation for his dead mule. It seems the animal was employed transporting luggage in the service of the Congress.

JAMES WILSON
The question, then, would appear to be one of occasion, for if the mule expired not while carrying, but after being unloaded, then surely the beast dropped dead on its own time!

JOHN
Good Godl!
~They may sit here for years and years in 
~Philadelphia!
~These indecisive grenadiers of
~Philadelphia! 
~They can't agree on what is right or wrong 
~Or what is good or bad.
~I'm convinced the only purpose 
~This Congress ever had
~Was to gather here, specifically, 
~To drive John Adams mad!
  
~You see we
~Piddle, twiddle, and resolve.
~Not one damned thing do we solve. 
~Piddle, twiddle, and resolve
~Nothing's ever solved in
~Foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy 
~Philadelphia—-

Abigail Adams, John's wife, a handsome woman of thirty-two, now appears in John's imagination and interrupts.

ABIGAIL
~John, John!
~Is that you carrying on, John?

JOHN
Oh, Abigail! Abigail— I have such a desire to knock heads together!

ABIGAIL
I know, my dearest. I know. But that's because you
make everything so complicated. It's al quite simple, really:
  
~Tell the Congress to declare 
~Independency!
~Then sign your name, get out of there, 
~and hurry home to me!
~Our children al have dysentery,
~Little Tom keeps turning blue.
~Little Abby has the measles
~And I'm coming down with flu.
~They say we may get smalipox—

JOHN
Madame, what else is new?

Music under.

JOHN
Abigail, in my last letter I told you that the King has collected twelve thousand German mercenaries to send against us. I asked you to organize the ladies and make saltpetre for gunpowder. Have you done as I asked?

ABIGAIL
No, John, I have not.

JOHN
Why have you not?

ABIGAIL
Because you neglected to tel us how saltpetre is made.

JOHN (impatient)
By treating sodium nitrate with potassium chloride, of course!

ABIGAIL
Oh, yes——of course.

JOHN
Will it be done, then?

ABIGAIL
I'm afraid we have a more urgent problem, John.

JOHN
More urgent, Madame?

ABIGAIL
~There's one thing every woman's missed in 
~Massachusetts Bay—
~Don't smirk at me, you egotist, pay
~Heed to what I say!
~We've gone from Framingham to Boston 
~And cannot find a pin.
~“Don't you know there isawar on?” 
~Says each tradesman with agrin. 
~Well!
~We will not make saltpetre
~Until you send us pins!

JOHN
Pins, Madame? Saltpetre?

ABIGAIL
Pins!

JOHN
Saltpetre!
Saltpetre!
Saltpetre!
'Petre!
'Petre!
'Petre!
'Petre!

ABIGAIL ^
Pins!
Pins!
Pins!
Pins!
Pins!
Pins!
_Pins!_

JOHN (beaten)
Done, Madame. Done.

ABIGAIL
Done, John
(Smiling)
Hurry home, John.

JOHN
As soon as I'm able,

ABIGAIL
Don't stop writing—- it's all I have.

JOHN
Every day, my dearest friend.

### "Till Then"

ABIGAIL
~Till then...

ABIGAIL AND JOHN
~Till then,
~I am, as I ever was, and ever shall be—
~Yours...
~Yours...
~Yours...
~Yours... Yours...

JOHN
~Saltpetre.
(He throws a kiss.)
~John.

ABIGAIL
~Pins.
(She throws a kiss)
Abigail.

She goes.

CONGRESS
~For God's sake, John, Sit down!

John turns, waves them off in disgust, then crosses.

JOHN (calling)
Franklin!

EXT. Scene 2 - The Mall

Sunlight. Benjamin Franklin sits on a bench, having his portrait painted.

John discovers him.

JOHN
Franklin! Where in God's name were you when I needed you?

FRANKLIN
Right here, John, being preserved for posterity. Do y'like it?

JOHN 
(after examining the painting carefully)
It stinks.

The painter goes.

FRANKLIN
As ever, the soul of tact.

JOHN
The man's no Botticelli.

FRANKLIN
And the subject's no Venus.

JOHN
Franklin! You heard what I suffered in there?

FRANKLIN
Heard? Of course 1 heard—- along with the rest of Philadelphia. Lord, your voice is piercing, John!

JOHN
I wish to heaven my arguments were. By God, Franklin, when will they make up their minds? With-one hand they can raise an army, dispatch one of their own to lead it, and cheer the news from Bunker's Hill—- while with the other they wave the olive branch, begging the King for a happy and permanent reconciliation. Why damn it,Fat George has declared us in rebellion—- why in bloody hell can't they?

FRANKLIN
John, really! You taik as if independence were the rule! It's never been done before! No colony has ever broken from the parent stem in the. history of the world!

JOHN
Dammit, Franklin, you make us sound treasonous!

FRANKLIN
Do I?
(Thinking)
Treason—- “Treason is a charge invented by winners as an excuse for hanging the losers,”

JOHN
I have more to do than stand here listening to you quote yourself.

FRANKLIN
No, that: was a new one!

JOHN
Dammit, Franklin, we're at war!

FRANKLIN
To defend ourselves, nothing more. We expressed our displeasure, the English moved against us, and we, in turn, have resisted, Now our fellow Congressmen want to effect a reconciliation before it becomes a war.

JOHN
Reconcilation my ass! The people want independence!

FRANKLIN
The people have read Mr, Paine's Common Sense. I doubt the Congress has.
(He studies him)
John, why don't you give it up? Nobody listens to you— you're obnoxious and disliked.

JOHN
I'm not promoting John Adams, I'm promoting independence.

FRANKLIN
Evidently they cannot help connecting the two.

JOHN (suspicious)
What are you suggesting?

FRANKLIN
Let someone else in Congress propose.

JOHN
Never!

Franklin shrugs.

JOHN
Who did you have in mind?

FRANKLIN
I don't know. I really haven't given it much thought.

Richard Henry Lee, a tall, loose-jointed Virginian aristocrat of forty-five, enters.

LEE
You sent for me, Benjamin?

JOHN (looking at Lee, then at Franklin)
Never!!

LEE
Halloo, Johnny.

JOHN (nodding)
Richard.

FRANKLIN
Richard, John and I need some advice.

LEE
If it's mine t'give, it's yours, y'know that.

FRANKLIN
Thank you, Richard, As you know, the cause that we support has come to a complete standstill. Now, why do you suppose that is?

LEE
Simple! Johnny, here, is obnoxious and disliked.

FRANKLIN
Yes, that's true. What's the solution, I wonder?

LEE (it's obvious)
Get someone else in Congress to propose—

FRANKLIN
Richard, that's brilliant! Wasn't that brilliant, John?

JOHN (dully)
Brilliant.

FRANKLIN
Yes. Now the question remains—- who can it be? The man we need must belong to a delegation publicly committed to support independence, and at the present time only Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Delaware have declared our way.

LEE
And Virginia, Benjy—- don't forget Virginia,

FRANKLIN
Oh, I haven't, Richard— how could I? But strictly speaking, while Virginia's views on independence are well known, your legislature in Williamsburg has never formally authorized its delegation here in Congress to support the cause. Of course, if we could think of a Virginian with enough influence to go down there and persuade the House of Burgesses—

LEE
Damn me if I haven't thought of someone!

FRANKLIN AND ADAMS (together)
Who?

LEE
Me

FRANKLIN
Why didn't I think of that!

LEE
I'll leave tonight—why, hell, right now, if y'like! I'l stop off at Stratford just long enough to refresh the missus, and then straight to the matter. Virginia, the land that gave us our glorious Commander-in-Chief—
(A short drumroll)
George Washington, will now give the continent its proposal on independence! And when Virginia proposes, the South is bound to follow, and where the South goes the Middle Colonies go! Gentlemen, a salute! To Virginia, the Mother of American Independence!

JONN
Incredible! We're free, and he hasn't even left yet!
(To Lee)
What makes you so sure you can do it?

### "The Lees of Old Virginia"
Music begins.

LEE
Hah!
~My name is Richard Henry Lee!
~Virginia is my home.
~My name is Richard Henry Lee!
~Virginia is my home,
~And may my horses turn to glue
~If I can't deliver up to you
~A resolution—on independency! 
  
~For I am F.F.V,
~The First Family
~In the Sovereign Colony of Virginia.
~The F.F.V,
~The Oldest Family
~In the oldest colony in America!
  
~And may the British burn my land 
~If I can't deliver to your hand
~A resolution -- on independency!
  
~Y'see it's—-
~Here a Lee
~There a Lee
~Everywhere a Lee, a Lee!

FRANKLIN
~Social—-
~Political--
~Financial—-
~Natural-—
~Internal-—
~External--
~Fraternal——
~E-ternal—-

LEE ^
~LEE!
~LEE!
~LEE!
~LEE!
~LEE!
~LEE!
~LEE!
~LEE!

FRANKLIN AND LEE
~The F.F.V.
~The First Family
~In the Sovereign Colony of Virginia!

LEE
~And may my wife refuse my bed 
~If I can't deliver (as I said)
~A resolution—on independency!

JOHN
Spoken modest-Lee. God help us!

FRANKLIN
He will, John! He will!

LEE
~They say that God in Heaven
~Is everybody's God

FRANKLIN
Amen!

LEE
~I'll admit that God in Heaven
~Is everybody's God.
~But I tell y', John, with pride,
~God leans a little on the side
~Of the Lees! The Lees of old Virginia!
  
~Y'see it's
~Here a Lee, there a Lee
~Everywhere a Lee--a Lee!

FRANKLIN AND LEE:
~Here a Lee, there a Lee 
~Everywhere a Lee-—

LEE
~Look out! There's
~Arthur Lee!
~“Bobby” Lee! ... an'
~General “Lighthorse” Harry Lee!
~Jesse Lee!
~Willie Lee!

FRANKLIN
And Richard H.—

LEE.
That's me!!
~And may my blood stop running blue
~If I can't deliver up to you
~A resolution—on independency!

He begins strutting, a military cakewalk.

LEE
~Yes sir, by God, it's
~Here a Lee!
~There a Lee!
~Come on, boys, join in with me!

They do, John reluctantly.

LEE
Here a Lee! There a Lee!

FRANKLIN
When do y'leave?

LEE
~Immediate-Lee!
~Here a Lee! There a Lee!

FRANKLIN
When will you return?

LEE
~Short-Lee
~Here a Lee! There a Lee!
~And I'll come back 
~Triumphant-Lee!

FRANKLIN AND JOHN:
~Here a Lee! There a Lee! 
~Ev'rywhere a Lee! A Lee!

LEE
~Forrr-warr...
~Ho-ooo!

Lee struts off. Franklin and John follow him almost as far as the wings, then drop out and return, breathless but relieved.

JOHN
That was the most revolting display I ever witnessed,

FRANKLIN
They're a warm-blooded people, Virginians!

JOHN
Not him, Franklin—-you! You and your infernal obsession for deviousness! If you'd come right out and asked him straight, he'd've been gone a half hour ago!

FRANKLIN
Cheer up, John. At this yery moment our cause is again riding high—sitting straight in the saddle and in full gallop for Virginia!

Lee suddenly reappears.

LEE
~And our women are... Serene...

JOHN
Oh, good God!

LEE
~Full-bosomed ...

FRANKLIN (perking up)
Full-bosomed?

LEE
~Full-bosomed, Benjy,
~Every one a queen! 
~Why, they are...

Music in, at tempo,

LEE
~Lees! Dammit!
~The Lees of old Virginia! Yes, sir! By God!

Waving his riding crop, he parades around, followed by Franklin and John.

ALL
~It's here a Lee!
~There a Lee!

LEE
~Come on, John,
~Step live-a-Lee!

ALL
~Here a Lee!
~There a Lee!
~Everywhere a Lee—a Lee!

Again Lee starts off, strutting. between, but ahead of, John and Franklin, who are halfheartedly marching after him, Suddenly Lee has stil another afterthought and turns back to express it-—but John and Franklin are ready for him this time, hooking his arms as he passes between them, and dragging the surprised and frustrated Virginian off backwards.

## June 7
INT. Scene 3 - The Chamber


Featured prominently, rear, is a tally board. Under three main headings (YEA, NAY, and ABSTAIN) are thirteen slots, each with a shuttle containing the name of a single colony. This device, during a vote, is the province of the Secretary of the Congress.

At rise, the Chamber is empty save for its aging custodian, Andrew McNair, who is preparing the room for the day's session with the help of a Leather Apron, a working man. The wall calen- dar now reads: “JUNE 7,” Then, as McNair sets out quill pens and fills the several inkwells from a large jar, Georgia's Dr. Lyman Hall, fifty-five, en- ters and looks around, finally clearing his threat. McNair leoks up.

@McNair
Yes?

HALL
I'm Dr. Lyman Hall, a new delegate from Georgia.

@McNair
I'm Andrew McNair, Congressional Custodian.
(He goes back to work.)
If you'll be wantin' anything at all just holler out, “McNair!” as you'll hear the others do, and there won't be too long to wait.

HALL (looking around)
Where does the Georgia deligation belong?

@McNair
Oh, they mill about over in that corner— near the two Carolinas.

HALL (checking his watch)
It's after ten, I was told the Congress convenes at ten.

@McNair
They'll be wanderin' in any time now, sir—with Old Grape 'n' Guts leadin' the pack.

HALL
Old who?

HOPKINS (Voice, offstage)
McNair!!

@McNair
Grape 'n'Guts.

Stephen Hopkins, a thin round-shouldered man of seventy, wearing a black suit, black Quaker hat, his gray hair at shoulder length, enters.

HOPKINS
Fetch me a mug o'rum!

@McNair
Mr. Hopkins, you'll be pleased to meet Dr. Lyman Hall—

HOPKINS
I don't need a doctor, dammit—

@McNair
—new delegate from Georgia—

HOPKINS
Why didn't you say so?
(To Hall)
I'm Stephen Hopkins, old delegate from Rhode Island. McNair! Two mugs o'rum!

HALL
I fear it's a little early in the day—

HOPKINS
Nonsense! It's a medicinal fact that rum gets a man's heart started in the morning—I'm surprised you didn't know it. And speaking as the oldest man in the Congress—

@McNair
Ben Franklin's older by almost a year—-

HOPKINS
Rum!

McNair scurries off.

HOPKINS
Tell me, Dr. Hall, where does Georgia stand on the question of independence?

Edward Rutledge, a young, handsome, dandified aristocrat of twenty-six, has entered.

RUTLEDGE
With South Carolina, of course.

HOPKINS (laughing)
Good morning, Neddy. Shake the hand of Dr. Lyman Hall from Georgia. Doctor, this here is Edward Rutledge from whichever Carolina he says he's from— God knows I can't keep 'em straight.

RUTLEDGE
A pleasure, Dr. Hall.

HALL
Your servant, Mr. Rutledge.

RUTLEDGE
Except for Ben Franklin—

HOPKINS
McNair!!

HOPKINS
You've met the long and short of it now, Doctor. Neddy here is only twenty-six; he's the youngest of us—

McNair has returned and now stands at Hopkins' elbow.

@McNair
Your rum,

HOPKINS
Where'd y'go for it, man— Jamaica?

Rutledge and Hall walk away.

RUTLEDGE
Where does Georgia stand on independence at the present time, Dr. Hall?

HALL
I am here without instructions, able to vote my own personal convictions.

RUTLEDGE
And they are—?

HALL (a pause; he examines him)
Personal.

RUTLEDGE
Dr. Hall, the Deep South speaks with one voice. It is traditional—even more, it is historical.

They regard one another for amoment. Then the Delaware delegation enters: Caesar Rodney, forty-eight, thin and pale, wears a green scarf tied around his face, covering some infirmity; George Read, forty-three, small and round, speaks with a high voice; and Colonel Thomas McKean, forty-two, tall and florid, has a booming voice decorated with a Scottlsh brogue. As always, the three are arguing,

RUTLEDGE
Enter Delaware— tria juncta in uno!

@McKean
Speak plain, Rutledge, y'know I can't follow none o'y'r damn French!

RUTLEDGE
Latin, Colonel McKean-- a tribute to the eternal peace and harmony of the Delaware delegation.

@McKean
What're y'sayin', man? Y'know perfectly well neither Rodney nor I can stand this little wart!
(He indicates Read.)

RUTLEDGE
Gentlemen, gentlemen, this is Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia—-Caesar Rodney, George Read, and Colonel Thomas McKean.

Hall shakes hands with each in turn and they exchange greetings.

RODNEY
Where do you stand on independence, sir?

HALL (a look to Rutledge)
With South Carolina, it seems.

RUTLEDGE
I leave the doctor in your excellent company, gentlemen.

Smiling, he bows and walks away, joining another group.

Slowly the Chamber has begun to fil with Congressmen: Lewis Morris and Robert Livingston of New York; Roger Sherman of Connecticut; Joseph Hewes of North Coralina; the portly Samuel Chase of Maryland; Josiah Bartlett of New Hampshire; others; and last to enter, unnoticed, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, thirty-three, six feet three, with copper-colored hair, carrying several books.

RODNEY (drawing Hall aside)
Tell me, sir, would you be a doctor of medicine or theology?

HALL
Both, Mr. Rodney. Which one can be of service?

RODNEY (good-naturedly)
By al means the physiclan first! Then we shall see about the other.

HALL (smiling)
I'll cal at your convenience, sir.

They are joined by two members of the Pennsylvania delegation: John Dickinson, forty-four, a thin, hawkish man, not without elegance, and James Wilson, thirty-three, a bespectacled, cautious little sycophant,

DICKINSON (pleasantly)
I trust, Caesar, when you're through converting the poor fellow to independency that you'll give the opposition a fair crack at him.

RODNEY
You're too late, John; once I get 'em they're got. Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia- -Mr. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania:

DICKINSON
An honor, sir.

HALL
Your servant.

WILSON (waiting)
Ahem.

RODNEY
Ah, Judge Wilson, forgive me—but how can any one see you if you insist on standing in Mr. Dickinson's shadow?
(To Hall)
James Wilson, also of Pennsylvania.

WILSON
Sir.

HALL
An honor, sir.

Franklin enters, limping on a cane, one foot bandaged,

FRANKLIN
Will you get out of my way, please? Good morning, all!

HALL (recognizing him)
Good Lord, do you have the honor to be Dr, Franklin?

FRANKLIN
Yes, I have that honor-—unfortunately the gout accompanies the honor.

HOPKINS
Been living too high again, eh, Pappy?

FRANKLIN
Stephen, I only wish King George felt like my big toe——all over!

HOPKINS
McNair!! Fetch a pillow-—and two more mugs of rum!

Now John enters the Chamber and looks around, searching for someone.

It is now evident that the colors and styles of the various costumes change gradually from colony to colony—from the fancy greens and golds of the Deep South to the somber blacks of New England.

FRANKLIN
Good morning, John!

JOHN (joining him)
Well, Franklin? Where's that idiot Lee? Has he returned yet? I don't see him.

FRANKLIN
Softly, John-— your voice is hurting my foot.

JOHN
One more day, Franklin— that's how long I'l! remain silent, and not a minute longer! That strutting popinjay was so damned sure of himself, He's had time to bring back a dozen proposals by now!

Dickinson turns to Wilson and addresses him in a loud voice, for all to hear.

DICKINSON
Tell me, James, how do you explain the strange, monumental quietude that Congress has been treated to these past thirty days?

Everyone, including John, has turned to listen.

DICKINSON
Has the ill wind of independence finally blown itself out?

WILSON
If you ask me—

DICKINSON
For myself, I must confess that a month free from New England noise is more therapeutic than a month in the country! Don't you agree, James?

WILSON
Well, I-—

DICKINSON (turning)
Mr. Adams, pray look for your voice, sir! It cannot be far and God knows we need the entertainment in this Congress!

Laughter from his fellow conservatives. Everyone turns to Adams, who is trembling with rage.

FRANKLIN
Congratulations, John, you've just made your greatest contribution to independence— you kept your flap shut!

JOHN
One more day... !

John Hancock, forty, takes his place at the President's desk; he is followed by Charles Thomson, forty-seven, the pedantic Secretary to the Congress. Hancock pounds his gavel.

HANCOCK
Gentlemen, the usual morning festivities concluded, I will now call the Congress to order.
(Gavel)
Mr. Thomson.

THOMSON (rising and ringing a bell)
The Second Continental Congress, meeting in the city of Philadelphia, is now in session, seventh June, seventeen seventy-six, the three hundred eightieth meeting.

@McNair
Sweet Jesus!

THOMSON
The Honorable John Hancock of Massachusetts Bay, President.

He rings the bells and sits.

HANCOCK
Thank you, Mr. Thomson.
(He swats a fly.)
Mr. McNair, the stores of rum and other drinking Spirits are hereby closed to the colony of Rhode Island for a period of three days.

@McNair
Yes, sir,

HOPKINS
John, y'can't do that!

HANCOCK
Sit down, Mr. Hopkins. You've abused the privilege. The Chair takes this opportunity to welcome Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia to this Congress and hopes he will make the best of it. My God, it's hot! The Secretary will read the roll.

THOMSON
All members present with the following exceptions: Mr. Charles Carroll of Maryland; Mr. Samuel Adams of Massachusetts; Mr. Button Gwinnett of Georgia; Mr. George Wythe and Mr. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia; and the entire delegation of New Jersey.

HANCOCK
I'm concerned over the continued absence of one thirteenth of this Congress, Where is New Jersey?

DICKINSON
Somewhere between New York and Pennsylvania.

HANCOCK
Thank you very much. Dr, Franklin, have you heard anything? Your son resides there.

FRANKLIN
Son, sir? What son?

HANCOCK (sorry he brought it up)
The Royal Governor of New Jersey, sir.

FRANKLIN
As that title might suggest, sir, we are not in touch at the present time.

HANCOCK
Yes, Very well-—-uh-—the weather report—-Mr. Jefferson of Virginia.

No reaction; Jefferson is reading a book.

HANCOCK
Mr. Jefferson!

JEFFERSON (jumping to his feet)
Present, sir!

HANCOCK
May we hear about the weather, as if it weren't speaking for itself.

JEFFERSON (going to several gauges at the window)
Eighty-seven degrees of temperature, thirty-point- aught-six inches of mercury, wind from the southwest for the rest of the day, and tonight—
(he turns)
—tonight I'm leaving for home.

HANCOCK
On business?

JEFFERSON
Family business.

HOPKINS
Give her a good one for me, young feller!

JEFFERSON (smiling)
Yes, sir, I will.

A uniformed courier, dusty from his long ride, enters and approaches Thomson, removing a communiqué from his pouch. He tosses itonto the Secretary's desk and leaves wearily.

THOMSON (ringing his bell)
From the Commander, Army of the United Colonies; in New York, dispatch number one thousand, one hundred and thirty-seven—

@McNair
Sweet Jesus!

THOMSON (reading)
“To the Honorable Congress, John Hancock, President. Dear Sir: It is with grave apprehension that I have learned this day of the sailing, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, of a considerable force of British troops in the company of foreign mercenaries and under the command of General Sir William Howe. There can be no doubt that their destination is New York, for to take and hold this city and the Hudson Valley beyond would serve to separate New England from the other colonies permitting both sections to be crushed in turn, Sadly, I see no way of stopping them at the present time as my army is absolutely falling apart, my military chest is totally exhausted, my Commissary General has strained his credit to the last, my Quartermaster has no food, no arms, no ammunition, and my troops are in a state of near mutiny! I pray God some relief arrives before the armada but fear it will not. Y'r ob'd't—”
(Drum roll.)
“G. Washington.”

During the brief silence that follows, Thomson shrugs and files the dispatch.

@McKean
Mr. President!

HANCOCK (wearily; he knows what's coming)
Colonel McKean.

@McKean
Surely we've managed to promote the gloomiest man on this continent to the head of our troops. Those dispatches are the most depressing accumulation of disaster, doom, and despair in the entire annals of military history! And furthermore—

HANCOCK (pounding his gavel)
Please, Colonel McKean— it's too hot.

@McKean
Oh. Yes. I suppose so.

HANCOCK
General Washington will continue wording his dispatches as he sees fit, and I'm sure we all pray that he finds happier thoughts to convey in the near —
(swats a fly)
—future. Mr. Thomson, are there any resolutions?

THOMSON
Dr. Josiah Bartlett of New Hampshire.

BARTLETT (rising and reading)
“Resolved: that for the duration of the present hostilities the Congress discourage every type of extravagance and dissipation, elaborate funerals and other expensive diversions, especially al horseracing-—”

He is shouted down by the entire Congress. Then the door bursts open and Lee sweeps in.

LEE
Benjy, I'm back-—-I'm back, Johnny!

He lets out Southern war whoop.

In a flash, John, Jefferson, McKean, and even the hobbling Franklin crowd around him.

@McKean
Richard, we're pleased t'see y'!

FRANKLIN
What news, Dickie boy, what news?

JOHN
Lee! Is it done?

LEE
First things first.
(Looking around)
Tom—where's Tom?
(Turning and seeing Jefferson)
Tom! Your little bride wants to know: “When's he coming home?”

JEFFERSON
I leave tonight!

JOHN (grabbing Lee's shoulders)
Never mind that-——is it done?

LEE
Done?
(A pause.)
Why, certain-Lee!

Cheers from those for independence.

LEE
Mr. President, I have returned from Virginia with the followin' resolution. 
(He produces a paper and reads.)
“Resolved: that these united colonies are (and of a right ought to be) free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is (and ought to be) totally dissolved!”

JOHN
Mr. President, I second the proposal!

A silence; then Hancock swats a fly.

HANCOCK
The resolution has been proposed and seconded, The Chair will now entertain debate,

DICKINSON (rising, assuming weariness)
Mr. President, Pennsylvania moves, as always, that the question of independence be postponed— indefinitely,

WILSON
I second the motion!

HANCOCK
Judge Wilson, in your eagerness to be loved you seem to have forgotten that Pennsylvania cannot second its own motion.

READ
Delaware seconds.

@McKean
You would, y'little weasel!

HANCOCK
The motion to postpone has been moved and seconded. Mr. Thomson.

Thomson goes to the tally board, As each colony votes, he announces it and McNair, in turn, mechanically records it on the board,

Hopkins, during his preparation, rises and leaves the Chamber.

THOMSON
On the motion to postpone indefinitely the resolution of independency or proceed with the debate, all those in favor of debate say “Yea,” al those for postponement say “Nay.”
(Intoning)
New Hampshire—

BARTLETT
New Hampshire favors debate and says Yea.

THOMSON
New Hampshire says Yea. Massachusetts—

JOHN
Massachusetts, having borne the brunt of the King's tyranny-——

THOSE AGAINST
Shamel! Shame!!

THOSE FOR ^
Sit down, John!

JOHN
Yes, I said tyranny! Massachusetts now and for all time says Yea!

THOMSON (flatly)
Massachusetts says Yea, Rhode Island— Mr. Hopkins? Where's Rhode Island?

@McNair
Rhode Island is out visitin' the “necessary.”

HANCOCK
After what Rhode Island's consumed, I can't say I'm surprised. We'll come back to him, Mr. Thomson,

THOMSON
Rhode Island passes.

Laughter Thomson looks around, not understanding, then proceeds.

HANCOCK
Connecticut—

He holds, as he will throughout the entire play, a shallow bowl of coffee; he is never without it?

SHERMAN
While Connecticut has, till now, been against this proposal, our legislature has instructed me that, in the event it is introduced by any colony outside of New England, Connecticut could not any longer withhold its support. Connecticut says Yea.

Franklin and John exchange satisfied looks.

THOMSON
Connecticut says Yea. New York—

MORRIS
Mr. Secretary, New York abstains— courteously.

THOMSON
New York abstains—-

MORRIS
—-courteously,

THOMSON
New Jersey-—

HANCOCK
Absent, Mr. Secretary,

THOMSON
New Jersey is absent. Pennsylvania—

DICKINSON
Pennsylvania, for the twenty-fourth time, says Nay.

THOMSON
Pennsylvania says Nay. Delaware—

RODNEY
Delaware, as ever for independence, says Yea.

THOMSON
Delaware says Yea. Mary-land—

CHASE
Mary-land would welcome independence if it were given but is highly skeptical that it can be taken. Mary-land says Nay.

THOMSON
Mary-land says Nay. Virginia—

LEE
Virginia, the First Colony, says Yea!

THOMSON
Virginia says Yea. North Carolina—

HEWES
North Carolina respectfully ylelds to South Carolina.

THOMSON
South Carolina—

RUTLEDGE
Mr. President, although we in South Carolina have never seriously considered the question of independence, when a gentleman proposes it, attention must be paid. However-—-we in the Deep South, unlike our friends in New England, have no cause for impatience at the present time. If, at some future date, it becomes the wish of all our sister colonies to effect a separation, we will not stand in the way. But for the time bein', South Carolina will wait— and watch. The vote is Nay.

THOMSON
South Carolina says Nay.

HEWES (jumping up)
North Carolina—~

THOMSON
—says Nay. Yes, Mr. Hewes, I know. Georgia—

Hall rises, looks around, but says nothing, obviously in great uncertainty.

THOMSON
Georgia—

HALL
Mr. Secretary—
(His eyes meet Rutledge's, then quickly look away.)
Georgia seems to be split right down the middle on this issue. The people are against it—-and I'm for it.
(Understanding laughter.)
But I'm afraid I'm not yet certain whether representing the people means relying on their judgment or on my own. So in al fairness, until I can figure it out, I'd better lean a little toward their side. Georgia says Nay.

THOMSON
Georgia says Nay.
(He checks the board.)
Rhode Island.
(Calling off)
Second call—- Rhode Island!

HOPKINS (offstage)
I'm comin'! I'm comin'!
(Entering)
Hold y'r damn horses!

THOMSON
We're waiting on you, Mr. Hopkins.

HOPKINS
It won't kil you. You'd think the Congress would have its own pisser! All right, where does she stand?

THOMSON
Five for debate, five for postponement, one abstention, and one absence.

HOPKINS
So it's up to me, is it? Well, I'll tel y'—in al my years I never heard, seen, nor smelled an issue that was so dangerous it couldn't be talked about. Hell yes, I'm for debatin' anything— Rhode Island says Yea!

Cheers from those for, including another war whoop from Lee, as they crowd around Hopkins,

HANCOCK
McNair, get Mr. Hopkins a rum!

@McNair
But you said—

HANCOCK
Get him the whole damn barrel if he wants!

@McNair
Yes, sir!

HANCOCK
The Chair now declares this Congress a committee-of-the-whole for the purpose of debating Virginia's resolution of independence. Mr. Dickinson.

DICKINSON
Well, now. You've got your way at last, Mr. Adams—— the matter may now be discussed. I confess I'm almost relieved. There's a question I've been fairly itching to ask you: Why?

JOHN
Why what, Mr. Dickinson?

DICKINSON
Why independence, Mr. Adams?

JOHN
For the obvious reason that our continued association with Great Britain has grown intolerable.

DICKINSON
To whom, Mr. Adams? To you? Then I suggest you sever your ties immediately. But please be kind enough to leave the rest of us where we are. Personally, I have no objections at all to being part of the greatest empire on carth, to enjoying its protection and sharing its benefits—

JOHN
Benefits? What benefits? Crippling taxes? Cruel repressions? Abolished rights?

DICKINSON
Is that all England means to you, sir? Is that all the affection and pride you can muster for the nation that bore you——for the noblest, most civilized nation on the face of this planet? Would you have us forsake Hastings and Magna Carta, Strongbow and Lionhearted, Drake and Marlborough, Tudors, Stuarts, and Plantagenets? For what, sir? Tell me for what? For you?
(He smiles, then turns.)
Some men are patriots, like General Washington-— some are anarchists, like Mr. Paine-— some even are internationalists, like Dr. Franklin. But you, sir, you are merely an a-gi-ta-tor, disturbing the peace, creating disorder, endangering the public welfare—and for what? Your petty litle personal complaints, Your taxes are too high. Well, sir, so are mine. Come, come, Mr. Adams, if you have grievances—and I'm sure you have— our present system must provide a gentler means of redressing them short of-
(suddenly his manner changes as he brings his fist down on the desk with a crash)
——-revolution!!
(Wheeling to the Congress)
That's what he wants—nothing less will satisfy him! Violence! Rebellion! Treason! Now, Mr. Adams, are these the acts of Englishmen?

JOHN
Not Englishmen, Dickinson—-Americans!

DICKINSON (again pounding the desk)
No, sir! Englishmen!!

FRANKLIN
(-——he's been asleep, his chin on his chest; now an eye opens:)
Please, Mr. Dickinson—but must you start banging? How is a man to sleep?

Laughter.

DICKINSON
Forgive me, Dr, Franklin, but must you start speaking? How is a man to stay awake?

Laughter.

DICKINSON
We'll promise to be quiet, sir. I'm sure everyone prefers that you remain asleep.

FRANKLIN
If I'm to hear myself called an Englishman, sir, then I assure you I'd prefer I'd remained asleep.

DICKINSON
What's so terrible about being called an Englishman? The English don't seem to mind.

FRANKLIN
Nor would I, were I given the full rights of an Englishman. But to call me one without those rights is like calllng an ox a bull—he's thankful for the honor but he'd much rather have restored what's rightfully his. 

Laughter, Franklin laughing the longest.

DICKINSON (finally)
When did you first notice they were missing, sir?

Laughter.

DICKINSON
Fortunately, Dr. Franklin, the people of these colonies maintain a higher regard for their mother country.

FRANKLIN
Higher, certainly, than she feels for them. Never was such a valuable possession so stupidly and recklessly managed than this entire continent by the British Crown. Our industry discouraged, our resources pillaged—- and, worst of ail, our very character stifled. We've spawned a new race here— rougher, simpler, more violent, more enterprising, and less refined. We're a new nationality, Mr. Dickinson—- we require a new nation.

DICKINSON
That may be your opinion, Dr. Franklin, but as I said, the people feel quite differently.

JOHN
What do you know about the people, Dickinson? You don't speak for the people: you represent only yourself. And that precious “status quo” you keep imploring the people to preserve for their own good is nothing more than the eternal preservation of your own property!

DICKINSON
Mr. Adams, you have an annoying talent for making such delightful words as “property” sound quite distasteful. In Heaven's name, what's wrong with property? Perhaps you've forgotten that many of us first came to these shores in order to secure rights to property—and that we hold those rights no less dear than the rights you speak of.

JOHN
So safe, so fat, so comfortable in Pennsylvania—

DICKINSON
And what is this independence of yours exccpt the private grievance of Massachusetts? Why, even your own cousin, so busy now with his seditious activitics in Boston that he has no time to attend this Congress, is a fugitive with a price on his head!

HANCOCK
Slowly, Mr. Dickinson. I remind you that the same price that covers Sam Adams also covefs me— we are wanted together.

DICKINSON
What did you expect? You both dress up like red savages in order to commit piracy against onc of His Majesty's ships—an event so embarrassing to your sister colonics that even your good friend Dr. Franklin offered to pay for al that spilt tea from his own pocket!

FRANKLIN
I'm usually able to speak for myself, Mr. Dickinson.

DICKINSON
Then tell me this: what good can come from this radicalism and civil disorder? Where can it lead except to chaos, mob rule, and anarchy? And why in God's name is it always Boston that breaks the King's peace?
(To the Congress)
My dear Congress you must not adopt this evil measure. It is the work of the devil. Leave it where it belongs-—- in New England.

SHERMAN
Brother Dickinson, New England his been fighting the devil for more than a hundred years.

DICKINSON
And as of now, “Brother” Sherman, the devil has been winning hands down!
(Indicating John)
Why, at this very moment he is sitting here in this Congress! Don't let him deceive you-—this proposal is entirely his doing! It may bear Virginia's name, but it reeks of Adams, Adams, and more Adams! Look at him—ready to lead this continent down the fiery path of total destruction!

JOHN
Good God! Why can't you acknowledge what already exists? It has been more than a year since Concord and Lexington. Dammit, man, we're at war right now!

DICKINSON
You may be at war—you: Boston and John Adams—but you will never speak for Pennsylvania!

READ (jumping up)
Nor for Delaware!

RODNEY
Mr. Read, you represent only one-third of Delaware!

READ
The sensible third, Mr. Rodney!

@McKean
Sit down, y'little roach, or I'll knock y'down!

HANCOCK
Sit down, all three of you! McNair!! Do something about these damned flies!

HOPKINS
McNair! Fetch me a rum!

HANCOCK
Get the flies first!

@McNair
I've only got two hands!

HANCOCK (mopping his brow)
Christ, it's hot! Please do go on, gentlemen; you're making the only breeze in Philadelphia.

RUTLEDGE
Mr. Adams, perhaps you could clear something up for me: after we have achieved independence, who do you propose would govern in South Carolina?

JOHN
The people, of course.

RUTLEDGE
Which people, sir? The people of South Carolina? Or the people of Massachusetts?

HOPKINS
Why don't you admit it, Neddy? You're against independence now, and you always will be.

@McKean
Aye!

RUTLEDGE
You refuse to understand us, gentlemen! We desire independence, yes— for South Carolina. That is our country. And as such we don't wish it to belong to anyone- not to England, and not to you,

JOHN
We intend to be one nation, Rutledge.

RUTLEDGE
A nation of sovereign states, Mr. Adams, united for our mutual protection, but separate for our individual pursuits, That is what we have understood it to be, and that is what we will support— as soon as everyone supports it.

WILSON
There you are, Mr. Adams, you must see that we need time to make certain who we are and where we stand in regard to one another—for if we do not determine the nature of the beast before we set it free, it will end by consuming us ail.

JOHN
For once in your life, Wilson—-take a chance. I say the time is now! It may never come again!

HEWES
Your clock is fast, Mr. Adams, I say we're not yet ripe for independence,

HOPKINS
Not ripe? Hell, we're rotting for want of it!

CHASE
Gentlemen, please. What in God's name is the infernal hurry? Why must this question be settled now?

RODNEY
What's wrong with now, Mr. Chase?

CHASE
General Washington is in the field. If he's defeated, as it now appears, we'll be inviting the hangman. But if, by some miracle, he should actually win, we can then declare anything we damn please!

HEWES
The sentiments of North Carolina precisely.

JOHN
Has it ever occurred to cither of you that an army needs something to fight for in order to win— a cause, a purpose, a flag of its own?

CHASE
Mr. Adams, how can a nation of only two million souls stand up to an cmpire of ten million? Think of it—- ten million! How do we compensate for that shortage?

FRANKLIN
It's simple, Mr, Chase—increase and multiply!

CHASE
How's that?

JOHN
We will more than compensate—with spirit! I tell you there's a spirit out there with the people that's sadly lacking in this Congress!

DICKINSON
Yes, of course——now it's spirit! Why didn't I think of that? No army, no navy, no arms, no ammunition, no treasury, no friends—but, bless our soul, spirit!
(Turning)
Mr. Lee, Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Rodney, Colonel McKean, Dr. Franklin, why have you joined this incendiary little man? This Boston radical, this a-gi-ta-tor, this demagogue—this madman!

JOHN
Are you calling me a madman, you—you-——-you— fribble!!

FRANKLIN
Easy, John!

JOHN
You and your Pennsyivania proprietors—you cool, considerate men! You keep to the rear of every issue so if we should go under you'll stil remain afloat!

DICKINSON
Are you calling me a coward?

JOHN
Yes! Coward!!

DICKINSON
Madman!!

JOHN
Landlord!

DICKINSON
Lawyer!!

The battle is joined, They begin whacking away at each other with their walking sticks. Congress is in an uproar,

HOPKINS
Whack him, John!

FRANKLIN
Ho, Spartacus!

CONGRESS
Stop! Go! For shame! At Last!
(Et cetera.)

Rodney now steps forward, between them, and pushes them apart.

RODNEY
Stop it! Stop itl! This is the Congress! Stop it, I say! The enemy is out there!

DICKINSON
No, Mr. Rodney, the enemy is here!

RODNEY
No, no, I say he's out there—-England, England, closing in, cutting off our air-—there's no time-— no air—
(He is stricken.)
Thomas!

He collapses into McKean's arms

@McKean
Caesar-—-Caesar!!

He looks around as the Congress falls silent and moves in.

@McKean
Doctor Hall?

HALL
(kneeling beside Rodney and looking under the green scarf; his expression reflects what he finds)
Colonel McKean—

@McKean
Aye, it's the cancer.

HALL
He should go home.

RODNEY (disgusted with himself)
Yes, a man. should die in his own bed. John-—John Adams—

JOHN
I'm here, Caesar.

RODNEY
I leave you adivided Delaware. Forgive me.

@McKean
I'l take y'home, Caesar.

He lifts Rodney and turns to John.

@McKean
Tll be back within the weck.

He carries Rodney out. 

There is a moment of silence; then Rutledge steps forward.

RUTLEDGE
Mr. President, South Carolina calls the question.

HANCOCK (distracted)
What's that, Mr. Rutledge?

RUTLEDGE (walking to the tally board)
I said, Mr. President, South Carolina desires to end the debate and—
(he moves the Delaware marker from the “Yea” to the “Nay” column)
— call the question of independence.

READ
(glowing)
Delaware scconds!

Again, bedlam, as everyone understands what has happened,

CONGRESS
No!
Yes!
You can't do that!
Call the question!
(Et cetera.)

HANCOCK (pounding for order)
Gentlemen, please! The question has been called and seconded. Mr. Secretary, you will record the vote.

JOHN (to Franklin)
Franklin, do something—think!

FRANKLIN
Ym thinking, I'm thinking——but nothing's coming!

THOMSON
All those in favor of the resolution on independence as proposed by the colony of Virginia signify by saying—

FRANKLIN
Mr. Secretary, would you read the resolution
again?
(As everyone looks at him in surprise, he shrugs.)
I've forgotten it.

Annoyed, Thomson looks to Hancock, who nods; he sighs.

THOMSON
“Resolved: That these United Colonies are (and
of a right ought to be) free and independent”

The Reverend John Witherspoon, a lean and as- cetic clergyman of fifty-four, enters.

WITHERSPOON
I beg your pardon, I'm the Reverend John Wither-
spoon, new delegate from New Jersey—?


As everyone moves in expectantly, he draws back, then seeks out the only familiar face.

WITHERSPOON
Dr. Franklin, I regret I must be the bearer of unhappy tidings, but your son, the Royal Governor of New Jersey, is taken prisoner and has been moved under guard to the colony of Connecticut for safe-keeping,

FRANKLIN
Is he unharmed, sir?

WITHERSPOON
When last I heard, he was, yes, sir.

FRANKLIN
Then why the long face? I hear Connecticut is an excellent location. Why'd they arrest the litle bastard?

WITHERSPOON (rattled)
Our-- uh— New Jersey legislature has recalled the old delegation to this Congress and has sent a new one.

JOHN
Quickly, man—where do y'stand on independence?

WITHERSPOON
Oh, haven't I made that clear? I s'pose I haven't. But that was the reason for the change—we've been instructed to vote for independence.

JOHN (quickly)
Mr, President!
(He goes to the tally board.)
Massachusetts is now ready for the vote on independence---
(he records New Jersey under the “Yes” column)
—and reminds the Chair of its privilege to decide all votes that are deadlocked!

HANCOCK
I won't forget, Mr. Adams. The Chair would like to welcome the Reverend Witherspoon and appoint him Congressional Chaplain if he will accept the post.

WITHERSPOON
With much pleasure, sir,

HANCOCK
Very well. Mr. Thomson, you may now-—
(he swats a fly)
—procced with the vote on independence.

THOMSON
All in favor of the resolution on independence as proposed by the colony of Virginia signify by saying-—

DICKINSON (jumping up)
Mr. President, Pennsylvania moves that any vote in favor of independence must be unanimous!

JOHN
What?

WILSON
I second the motion!

HANCOCK (admonishing)
Judge Wilson—

WILSON (chagrined)
Oh my God.

READ
Delaware seconds, Mr. President.

JOHN
No vote's ever had to be unanimous, Dickinson, and you know it!

DICKINSON
Yes, but this one must be.

JOHN
On what grounds?

DICKINSON
That no colony be torn from its mother country without its own consent.

RUTLEDGE
Hear, hear!

JOHN
But it'l never be unanimous, dammit!

DICKINSON
If you say so, Mr. Adams.

THOMSON
It has been moved and seconded that the vote on independence must be unanimous in order to carry. All those in favor signify by saying “Yea”.

Dickinson, Chase, Read, Rutledge, Hewes, and Hall say “Yea.”

THOMSON
Six colonies say “Yea.” All those opposed signify by saying “Nay.”

John, Bartlett, Hopkins, Sherman, Lee, and Witherspoon say “Nay.”
Six colonies say “Nay.”

MORRIS
Mr. Secretary, New York abstains—courteously.

HANCOCK
Mr. Morris, why does New York constantly abstain? Why doesn't New York simply stay in New York? Very well, the vote is tied.
(He covers his eyes for a moment.)
The principles of independence have no greater advocate in Congress than its President—and that is why I must join those who vote for unanimity.

JOHN
(as the Congress reacts, stunned, he jumps up, horrified)
Good God! What're y'doing, John? You've sunk us!

HANCOCK
Hear me out, Don't you see that any colony who opposes independence will be forced to fight on the side of England—that we'll be setting brother against brother, that our new nation will carry as its emblem the mark of Cain? I can see no other way. Either we walk together or together we must stay where we are.

A silence,

HANCOCK
Very well. Proceed, Mr. Thomson.

THOMSON
A unanimous vote being necessary to carry, if any be opposed to the resolution on independence as proposed by the colony of Virginia, signify by saying-—

JOHN
Mr. President!!

THOMSON
For heaven's sake, let me get through it once!

JOHN
Mr. President, I move for a postponement!

FRANKLIN
Mr. Adams isright, we need apostponement!

DICKINSON
On what grounds?

FRANKLIN (to John)
On what grounds?

JOHN
Mr. President, how can this Congress vote on independence without-——uh— a written declaration of some sort defining it?

HANCOCK
What sort of declaration?

JOHN
Well, you know-— uh— listing al the reasons for the separation and-- uh- our goals and aims and so on and so forth, ditto, ditto, et cetera, et cetera.

HANCOCK (not getting it)
We know those, don't we?

JOHN
Well, good God, yes, we know them, but what about the rest of the world? Certainly we require the aid of a powerful nation like France or Spain, and such a declaration would be consistent with European delicacy.

CHASE
Come, now, Mr. Adams, you'll have to do better than that! Answer straight—what would te its purpose?

A pause; for once John is at a loss for words.

JOHN
Yes, well—.

JEFFERSON (rising and speaking deliberately)
To place before mankind the common sense of the subject, in terms so plain and firm as to command their assent.

Winking at John, he sits. A moment of surprise; then Dickinson laughs.

DICKINSON
Mr. Jefferson, are you scriously suggesting that we publish a paper declaring to al the world that an illegal rebellion is, in reality, a legal one?

FRANKLIN
Why, Mr. Dickinson, I'm surprised at you! You should know that rebellion is always ilegal in the first person—such as “our” rebellion. It is only in the third person—“their” rebellion—that it is illegal.
(Laughter)
Mr. President, I second the motion to postpone the vote on independence for a period of time sufficient for the writing of a declaration.

HANCOCK
It has been moved and seconded. Mr. Secretary—

THOMSON
All those in favor of the motion to postpone signify by saying “Yea.”

Adams, Bartlett, Hopkins, Sherman, Witherspoon, and Lee say “Yea.”

THOMSON
Six colonies say “Yea.” Against?

Dickinson, Chase, Read, Rutledge, Hewes, and Hall say “Nay.”

THOMSON
Six colonies say “Nay.”

MORRIS
Mr. Secretary, New York abstains—courteously.

HANCOCK
(threatening him with his fly-swatter, then restraining himself)
Mr. Morris! What in hell goes on in New York?

MORRIS
I'm sorry, Mr, President, but the simple fact is that our legislature has never sent up explicit instructions on anything.

HANCOCK
Never? That's impossible!

MORRIS
Have you ever been present at a meeting of the New York legislature? They speak very fast and very loud and nobody pays any attention to anybody else, with the result that nothing ever gets done. I beg the Congress' pardon.

HANCOCK
My sympathies, Mr. Morris. The vote again being tied, the Chair decides in favor of the postponement.
(His gavel.)
So ruled, A committee will now be formed to manage the declaration, said document to be written, debated, and approved by the beginning of July, three weeks hence, at which time Virginia's resolution on independence will finally be voted. Is that clear?
(Meeting general agreement)
Very well. Will the following gentlemen
serve on the Declaration Committee. Dr. Franklin, Mr. John Adams, Mr. Sherman, Mr. Livingston, and, of course, Mr. Lee.

LEE
Excuse me, but I must be returnin' to the sovereign country of Virginia as I have been asked to serve as governor. Therefore I must decline— respectful- Lee!

HANCOCK
Very well, Mr. Lee, you're excused. I suppose we could leave it a four-man committee.

JOHN
Just a moment. This business needs a Virginian. Therefore, I propose a replacement-—- Mr. Thomas Jefferson!

JEFFERSON
No, Mr. Adams, no!

HANCOCK
Very well, Mr. Adams, Mr. Jefferson will serve.

JEFFERSON
I'm going home too— to my wife!

JOHN
Move to adjourn!

JEFFERSON
No, wait—

FRANKLIN
Second!!

JEFFERSON
It's been six months since I've seen her!

HANCOCK
Moved and seconded-—any objections?

JEFFERSON
Yes! I have objections!

HANCOCK (gaveling)
So ruled, Congress stands adjourned!

JEFFERSON (on deaf ears)
I need to see my wife, I tell you!

Congress rises and goes as John, Franklin, Sherman and Livingston move downstage, with Jefferson following, still protesting.

### "But, Mr. Adams"
Music begins.

JOHN
All right, gentlemen! Let's get on with it. Which of us is going to write our declaration on independence?

FRANKLIN
~Mr. Adams, I say you should write it,
~To your legal mind and brilliance we defer.

JOHN
Is that so!
~Well, if I'm the one to do it,
~They'll run their quill pens through it.
~I'm obnoxious and disliked, you know that, sir!

FRANKLIN
Yes, I know.

JOHN
~Then I say you should write it, Franklin, yes, you!

FRANKLIN
Hell, no!

JOHN
~Yes, you, Dr. Franklin, you!

FRANKLIN
~But—

JOHN
~You!

FRANKLIN
~But—-

JOHN
~You!

FRANKLIN
~But—
~Mr. Adams!
~But-—-Mr. Adams!
~The things I write
~Are only light extemporanea,
~I won't put politics on paper.
~It's a mania.
~So, I refuse to use the pen——in Pennsylvania!

A Glee Club is formed by Sherman, Livingston, and Franklin,

GLEE CLUB
~Pennsylvania!
~Pennsylvania!
~Refuse
~To use ... the pen!

John begins to pace, thinking.

JOHN
~Mr. Sherman, I say you should write it. 
~You are never “controversial,” as it were.

SHERMAN
That is true.

JOHN
~Whereas, if I'm the one to do it
~They'll run their quill pens through it.
~I'm obnoxious and disliked, you know that, sir.

SHERMAN
Yes, I do.

JOHN
~Then you should write it, Roger, you.

SHERMAN
Good heavens, no!

JOHN
~Yes, you, Roger Sherman, you!

SHERMAN
~But-

JOHN
You!

SHERMAN
But-—

JOHN
You!

SHERMAN
~But—
~Mr. Adams!
~But- Mr. Adams!
~I cannot write with any style Or proper etiquette.
~I don't know a preposition
~From a predicate.
~I am just a simple cobbler 
~From Connecticut!

GLEE CLUB
~Connecticut!
~Connecticut!
~A simple cobbler ... he!

John resumes his pacing.

JOHN
~Mr. Livingston, maybe you should write it.
~You have many friends, and you're a diplomat.

FRANKLIN
Oh, that word!

JOHN
Whereas, if I'm the one to do it, They'll run their quill pens through it.

GLEE CLUB
He's obnoxious and disliked, did you know that?
LiviNGsTon, speaking: Ihadn't heard—-

JOHN
Then Isay you should write it, Robert! Yes, you!

LIVINGSTON
Not me, Johnny!

JOHN
Yes! You, Robert Livingston—you!

LIVINGSTON
But—

JOHN
You!

LIVINGSTON
But—

JOHN
You!

LIVINGSTON
But--
Mr. Adams!
Dear Mr, Adams!
I've been presented with a new son By the noble stork,
So I am going home to celebrate And pop acork
With al the Livingstons together, Back in old New York!

GLEE CLUB
New York!
New York!
Livingston's ...
Going to pop ... a cork!

Slowly, all eyes turn to Jefferson.

JEFFERSON
Mr. Adams!
Leave me Alone!!!

The Glee Club sings a “La-la” theme, under.

JOHN (speaking firmly)
Mr. Jefferson—

JEFFERSON
Mr. Adams, I beg you! I've not seen my wife these six months!

JOHN
“.. and we solemnly declare we will preserve our liberties, being with one mind resolved to die free men-~—rather than to live slaves!”
(The Glee Club stops to listen.)
Thomas Jefferson, on the “Necessity of Taking Up Arms,” seventeen seventy-five, magnificent! You write ten times better than any man in the Con- gress—-including me! For a man of only thirty-three years you possess a happy taient for composition and a remarkable felicity of expression, Now! Will you bea patriot? Or a lover?

JEFFERSON
A lover!

JOHN
No!

JEFFERSON
~But I burn, Mr. A.!

JOHN
So do I, Mr. J.!

Everything stops.

JEFFERSON
You?

SHERMAN
You do?

FRANKLIN
John!

LIVINGSTON
Who'd 'a'thought it?

JOHN
~Mr. Jefferson,
~Dear Mr. Jefferson,
~I'm only forty-one,
~I still have my virility!
~And I can romp through Cupid's grove 
~With great agility!
~But life is more than 
~Sexual combustibility!

GLEE CLUB
Bust-a-bility!
Bust-a-bility!
Com-bust-a-bil-i-—

JOHN (shouting)
Quiet!
(He sings)
~Now, you'll write it, Mr, J.1

JEFFERSON
(six feet three)
Who will make me, Mr, A,?

JOHN
(five feet elght)
I!

JEFFERSON
You?

JOHN
Yes!

JEFFERSON
How?

JOHN
By-—by physical force if necessary! It's your duty
—your duty, dammit!!

JEFFERSON
~Mr. Adams!
~Damn you, Mr. Adams!
~You're obnoxious and disliked, That cannot be denied.
(This is agreed to by all.)
Once again you stand between me And my lovely bride!

GLEE CLUB
Lovely bride!

JEFFERSON
Oh, Mr. Adams, you are driving me... to Homicide!!

GLEE CLUB
Homicide! Homicide!

JOHN (roaring)
Quiet!!
(He is furious.)
The choice is yours, Mr. Jefferson!
(He thrusts a large quill pen into Jeffer- son's hand)
(evenly)
Do—as—-you—like—with— it.


GLEE CLUB (gleefully)
We may see mur-der yet!!

John goes, followed by the others.

Jefferson, alone, studies the pen for a moment,
then turns and heads for his lodgings, still regard- ing the pen as he goes.

INT Scene 4 - Jefferson's room

Jefferson's room, above High Street, It is spare and unaffected, like the man, with a desk, a cupboard, a chair, a couch, and a music stand; a violin sits on the desk,

Jefferson mounts the steps and enters his apartment. He takes another look at the pen and throws it onto the desk angrily.

JEFFERSON
Damn the man!
(He removes his coat; then he catches sight of the pen again.)
GOD damn the man!

Then, resigned, he sits at the desk and writes a few words, Suddenly he crumples the page and throws it on the floor. He writes some more; but again he crumples the paper and throws it on the floor. Now, merely thinking some unacceptable words, he crumples still another sheet, this one blank. Discouraged, he sits back, picks up his violin to play.

Meanwhile, John and Franklin have appeared out- side and now enter. Franklin heads for the couch and stretches out, closing his eyes.

JOHN
Jefferson, are y'finished?
(There is no answer.)
You've had a whole week, man. Is it done? Can I see it?

Jefferson points to all the crumpled paper on the floor. John picks one at random and, flattening it out, reads it,

JOHN
“There comes a time in the lives of men when it becomes necessary to advance from that subordination in which they have hitherto remained—” this is terrible.
(Looking up.)
Where's the rest of it?
(Again Jefferson points to the floor.)
Do you mean to say it's not finished?

JEFFERSON
No, sir-—-I mean to say it's not begun.

JOHN
Good God! A whole week! The entire earth was created in a week!

JEFFERSON (fed up, turning to John)
Some day you must tell me how you did it.

JOHN
Disgusting! Look at him, Franklin— Virginia's most famous lover—

JEFFERSON
Virginia abstains.

JOHN
Cheer up, Jefferson, get out of the dumps. It'll come out right, I promise you. Now get back to work. Franklin, tel him to get to work.

JEFFERSON
He's asleep.

Outside, a cloaked woman appears. She stops, looks around, then sees the door and enters. It is Martha, Jefferson's wife, a lovely girl of twenty- seven.

FRANKLIN
(sitting bolt upright on the couch)
View-hal-loo, and whose-little-girl are you?

But Jefferson and Martha are suddenly oblivious to everything but each other as they meet and em- brace. They kiss, and kiss, and will continue kissing throughout the remainder of the scene.

FRANKLIN
John, who is she?

JOHN
His wife
(he studies them)
I hope.

FRANKLIN (his eyes never leaving them)
What makes y'think so?

JOHN
Because I sent for her.

FRANKLIN
Y' what?

JOHN
It simply occurred to me that the sooner his problem was solved, the sooner our problem was solved.

FRANKLIN
Good thinking, John, good thinking!

JOHN (stepping forward)
Madame, may I present mysclf? John Adams.
(No reaction)
Adams-- John Adams!
(Nothing)
And Dr, Franklin.
(Nothing.)
Inventor of the stovel!!
(No luck.)
Jefferson, would you kindly present me to your wife?
(No reaction)
She is your wife, isn't she?

FRANKLIN
Of course she is—look how they fit!
(Starting for the door)
Come along, John, come along.

JOHN
Come along where? There's work to be done!

FRANKLIN
(with a look back over his shoulder)
Heh! Obviously!

Outside, on the street.

JOHN
Good God! Y'mean they— They're going to—
(He stops.)
In the middle of the afternoon?

FRANKLIN
Not everybody's from Boston, John.

He takes John's arm and leads him aside. John keeps look- ing back, unabie to get over it.

JOHN
Incredible.

FRANKLIN
Well—good night, John.

JOHN
Have y'eaten, Franklin?

FRANKLIN
Not yet, but-—

JOHN
I hear the turkey's fresh at the Bunch o' Grapes,

FRANKLIN
I have a rendezvous, John.

JOHN
Oh.

FRANKLIN
I'd ask you along, but talking makes her nervous.

JOHN
Yes, of course.

FRANKLIN -
Good night, then.

JOHN
Good night.
(Franklin goes, It has grown dark, John stands for a moment, lost in thought. Then he turns and looks up at the lighted window, just as Jefferson's violin is heard playing a lush arpeggio. An instant later the light goes out.)
Incredible.
(Music begins.)
Oh, Abigail—
(Abigail appears, as before.)
I'm very lonely, Abigail.

ABIGAIL
Are you, John? Then as long as you were sending for wives, why didn't you send for your own?

JOHN
Don't be unreasonable, Abigail.

ABIGAIL
Now I'm unreasonable— you must add that to your list.

JOHN
List?

ABIGAIL
The catalogue of my faults you included in your last letter.

JOHN
They were fondly intended, madame!

ABIGAIL
That I play at cards badly?

JOHN
A compliment!

ABIGAIL
That my posture is crooked?

JOHN
An endearment!

ABIGAIL
That I read, write, and think too much?

JOHN
An irony!

ABIGAIL
That I am pigeon-toed?

JOHN
Ah, well, there you have me, Abby—I'm afraid you are pigeon-toed.
(Smiling)
Come to Philadelphia, Abigail— please come.

ABIGAIL
Thank you, John, I do want to. But you know it's not possible now. The children have the measles.

JOHN
Yes, so you wrote— Tom and litle Abby.

ABIGAIL
Only now it's Quincy and Charles. And it appears the farm here in Braintree is failing, John—the chickens and geese have all died and the apples never survived the late frost. How do you s'pose she managed to get away?

JONN
(with a glance to the shuttered window)
The winters are softer in Virginia.

ABIGAIL
And their women, John?

JOHN
Fit for Virginians, madame, but pale, puny things beside New England girls!

ABIGAIL (pleased)
John! I thank you for that.

A pause.

JOHN
How goes it with you, Abigail?

ABIGAIL
Not well, John—-not at all well.
~I live like a nun in a cloister, Solitary, celibate, I hate it. 
And you, John?

JOHN
~Hm!
~I live like a monk in an abbey, Ditto, ditto, I hate it.

ABIGAIL
~Write to me with sentimental effusion
~Let me revel in romantic illusion.

JOHN
~Do y'still smell of vanilla and spring air?
~And is my fav'rite lover's pillo' stil firm and fair?

ABIGAIL
~What was there, John!
~Still in there, John!
~Come soon as you can to my cloister,
~I've forgotten the feel of your hand.

JOHN
~Soon, Madame, we shall walk In Cupid's grove together...

JOHN AND ABIGAIL:
~And we'll fondly survey that promised land!
~Till then, til then,
~I am, as I ever was, and ever shall be, 
~Yours...
~Yours...
~Yours...
~Yours...
~Yours...

ABIGAIL (beating him to it)
Saltpetre, John!

And she goes.

John smiles, Now the daylight returns; it's the next morning. Franklin enters,

FRANKLIN
Sorry to be late, John—I was up till all hours, Have y'been here long?

JOHN
Not long.

FRANKLIN
And what're y'doing out here? I expected you'd be up there cracking the whip.

JOHN
The shutters are stil closed.

FRANKLIN
My word, so they are! Well, as the French say—

JOHN
Oh, please, Franklin! Spare me your bawdy mind first thing in the morning!
(They regard the closed shutters.)
Dare we call?

FRANKLIN
A Congressman dares anything. Go ahead.

JOHN
Me?

FRANKLIN
Your voice is more picrcing.

JOHN
(he starts, then hesitates)
This is positively indecent!

FRANKLIN
Oh, John, they're young and they're in love.

JOHN
Not them, Franklin—us! Standing out here—
(he gestures vaguely at the shuttered room)
—waiting for them to— I mean, what will people think?

FRANKLIN
Don't worry, John. The history books will clean it up.

JOHN
It doesn't matter. 1 won't appear in the history books, anyway— only you. 
(He thinks about it.)
Franklin did this, Franklin did that, Franklin did some other damned thing. Franklin smote the ground, and out sprang George Washington, fully grown and on his horse. Franklin then electrified him with his miraculous lightning rod, and the three of them—-Franklin, Washington, and the horse— conducted the entire Revolution all by themselves.

A pause.

FRANKLIN
I like it!

Now the shutter opens and Martha appears, dressed and radiant. She is humming a tune.

FRANKLIN
Look at her, John——just loox at her!

JOHN (hypnotized)
I am.

FRANKLIN
She's even more magnificent than I remember! Of course, we didn't see much of her front last night.
(Calling)
Good morrow, madame!

She looks down at him blankly.

JOHN
Good morrow!

MARTHA
Is it the habit in Philadelphia for strangers to shout at ladies from the street?

FRANKLIN
Not at all, madame, but we're not—

MARTHA
And from men of your age it is not only unseemly, it's unsightly.

JOHN
Excuse me, madame, but we met last evening,

MARTHA
I spoke to no one last evening.

FRANKLIN
I ndeed you did not, madame, but nevertheless we presented ourselves. This is Mr. John Adams and I am Dr. Franklin.
(As she stares at them, dum- founded.)
Inventor of the stove?

MARTHA
Oh, please, I know your names very well. But you say you presented yourselves?

FRANKLY (smiling)
It's of no matter, Your thoughts were well taken elsewhere,

MARTHA
(turning to the room for amoment)
My husband is not yet up.

FRANKLIN
Shall we start over? Please join us, madame.

MARTHA
Yes, of course.

She disappears from the window.

FRANKLIN
No wonder the man couldn't write. Who could think of independence, married to her?

She appears, smiling

MARTHA
I beg you to forgive me. It is indeed an honor meeting the two greatest men in America.

FRANKLIN (smiling back)
Certainly the greatest within earshot, anyway.

MARTHA
I am not an idle flatterer, Dr. Franklin. My husband admires you both greatly.

FRANKLIN
Then we are doubly flattered, for. we admire very much that which your husband admires.

A pause as ‘they regard each other warmly. They have hit it off.

JOHN
(finally; the bull in the china shop)
Did you sleep well, madame?
(Franklin nudges him with his elbow.)
I mean, did you lie comfortably? Oh, damn! Y'know what I mean!

FRANKLIN
Yes, John, we do. Tell us about yourself, madame; we've had precious little information. What's your first name?

MARTHA
Martha.

FRANKLIN
Ah. Martha, He might at least have told us that. I'm afraid your husband doesn't say very much.

JOHN
He's the most silent man in Congress, I've never heard him utter three sentences together.

FRANKLIN
Not everyone's a talker, John.

MARTHA
It's true, you know.
(She turns to look at the window.)
Tom is not—a talker.

### "He Plays the Violin"
She sings.

MARTHA
~Oh, he never speaks his passions, 
~He never speaks his views.
~Whereas other men speak volumes,
~The man I love is mute.
  
~In truth
~I can't recall
~Being woo'd with words At all.
~Even now...

Music continues under.

JOHN
Go on, madame,

FRANKLIN
How did he win you, Martha, and how does he hold onto a bounty such as you?

MARTHA
Surely you've noticed that Tom is a man of many accomplishments: author, lawyer, farmer, architect, statesman—
(she hesitates)
—and still one more that I hesitate to mention.

JOHN
Don't hesitate, madame— don't hesitate!

FRANKLIN
Yes, what else can that redheaded tombstone do?

MARTHA
(looks at them for a moment, then leans in und sings, confidentially)
~He plays the violin
~He tucks itright under his chin,
~And he bows,
~Oh, he bows,
~For he knows,
~Yes, he knows, that it's...
~Heigh, heigh, heigh diddic-diddle, 
~'Twixt my heart, Tom, and his fiddle, 
~My strings arc unstrung. 
~Heigh-hcigh-heigh-heigh-igh-igh ... 
~Heigh— I am undone!

John and Franklin look at one another, not at all sure if she's putting them on or not.

FRANKLIN
The violin, madame?

MARTHA
~I hear his violin,
~And I get that fecling within, And I sigh...
~Oh, I sigh...
~He draws near,
~Very near, and it's...
~Heigh, heigh, heigh diddle-diddlc, and... 
~Good-bye to the fiddle!
~My strings are unstrung.
  
~Heigh-heigh-heigh-heigh-igh-igh ... 
~Heigh—I'm always undone!

FRANKLIN
That settles it, John, we're taking up the violin!

JOHN (to Martha)
Very well, madame, you've got us playing the violin! What happens next?

MARTHA
Next, Mr. Adams?

JOHN
Yes! What does Tom do now?

MARTHA (demurely)
Why, just what you'd expect.
(John and Franklin exchange expectant looks.)
We dance!

together and to each other

JOHN
Dance?

FRANKLIN ^
Dance?

FRANKLIN
Incredible!

MARTHA
One-two-three, one-two-three!

And in an instant she has swept Franklin off into an energetic waltz, John watches them jor a mo- ment, still trying to understand,

JOHN
Who's playing the violin?

FRANKLIN
Oh, John—-really!

And Martha leaves Franklin to begin waltzing with John, who, to Franklin's astonishment, turns out to dance expertly.

FRANKLIN
John! You can dance!


JOHN
(executing an intricate step— he is having a grand time)
We stil do a few things in Boston, Franklin!

Finally they have twirled and spun and danced themselves out.

MARTHA
(singing, as she catches her breath)
~When Heaven calls to me,
~Sing me no sad elegy!
~Say Idied
~Loving bride,
~Loving wife,
~Loving life.
~Oh, it was...

MARTHA, JOHN, FRANKLIN
Heigh, heigh, heigh diddie-diddle ...

MARTHA
~Twixt my heart, Tom, and his
~Fiddle, and
~Ever ‘twill be
~Heigh-heigh-heigh-heigh-igh-igh ... 
~Heigh, through eternity.

FRANKLIN (in counterpoint)
He plays the violin...

JOHN (in counterpoint)
He plays the violin...

MARTHA (in counterpoint)
He plays the violin!

They bow to her, and she curtsies.

Now Jefferson appears, a fiddle under his arm, and stuck on the end of his bow is a paper. He collects his wife, and together they start back toward the room.

JOHN
Franklin, look! He's written something—he's done it!
(He dashes after them, snatches the paper off the bow, and comes back to Franklin, delighted, and reads it.)
“Dear Mr. Adams: I am taking my wife back to bed. Kindly go away. Y'r ob'd't, T. Jeffer- son.”

FRANKLIN
What, again?

JOHN
Incredible!

FRANKLIN
Perhaps I'm the one who should've written the declaration, after all. At my age there's little doubt that the pen is mightier than the sword.
~For it's
~Heigh, heigh, heigh diddle-diddle.
(Enviously)
~And God bless the man who can fiddle...

JOHN (ever the old warhorse)
An independency!

JOHN AND FRANKLIN
(regaining their energy)
~Heigh-heigh-heigh-heig-igh-igh. Yata-ta-ta-tah!
~Through eternity!
(And they exit arm in arm.)
~He plays the violin... Violin! ... Violin! ...

## June 22

INT Scene 5 The Chamber

At rise, Congress is in session, though in an exceedingly loose manner, While Secretary Thomson delivers a droning report, it is clear that no one is listening. Hancock sits at the President's table, but he is occupied reading the Philadelphia Gazette, his feet up on the desk; one group of Congressmen-—— Morris, Read, Wilson, and Dickinson—sit with their heads together, talking; another group-——Hopkins, Bartlett, and Sherman-—stands in the rear, also conversing; Rutledge and Hewes pace back and forth across the length of the Chamber as they talk; McKean stands by the window, cleaning a long rifle; Chase, a large napkin tied around his neck, sits eating a complete meal; Witherspoon is asleep at his desk, his head thrown back, his mouth open and snoring; and McNair is kept hopping from one group to another on this errand and that, The wall calendar now reads: “JUNE 22.”

THOMSON
...and what follows is a complete and up-to- date list of the committees of this Congress now sitting,about to sit,or just having sat: A committee formed to investigate a complaint made against the quality of yeast manufactured at Mr. Henry Pendleton's mill, designated as the Yeast Committee; a committee formed to consider the most effective method of dealing with spies, designated as the Spies Committee; A committee formed to think, perhaps to do, but in any case to gather, to meet, to confer, to talk, and perhaps even to resolve that each rifle regimient be allowed at least -one drum and one fife attached to each company,
designated as the Drum and Fife Committee; a committee formed to...

Franklin and Dr. Hall have entered and now stand surveying the room,

FRANKLIN
Look at it, doctor—-democracy! What Plato called a “charming form of government, ful of variety and disorder.” I never knew Plato had been to Philadelphia,

HANCOCK
(as he reads the newspaper)
McNair! Open that damn window!

HOPKINS
(joining Franklin and Hall, a mug of rum In hls hand)
Ben, I want y'to see some cards I've gone 'n' had printed up that ought t'save everybody here a whole lot of time 'n' effort, considering the epidemic of bad disposition that's been going around lately.
(He reads)
“Dear sir; You are without any doubt a rogue, a rascal, a villain, a thief, ascoundrel, and a mean, dirty, stinking, sniveling, sneaking, pimp- ing, pocket-picking, thrice double-damned, no good son-of-a-bitch”—and y'sign y'r name. What do y'think?

FRANKLIN (delighted)
Stephen, I'l take a dozen right now!

THOMSON
... a committee formed to answer all Congressional correspondence designated as the Congressional correspondence Committee ...

John strides in and joins Franklin.

JOHN
All right, Franklin, enough socializing-— there's work to be done!

FRANKLIN (pointedly)
Good morning, John!

JOHN
What? Oh.
(Waving it aside)
Good morning, good morning. Now, then, let's get to it.

FRANKLIN
Let's get to what?

JOHN (indicating the tally board)
Unanimity, of course. Look at that board—six nays to win over in little more than a week!

THOMSON
...a committee formed to consider the problem of counterfeit money, designated as the Counterfeit Money Committee ...

FRANKLIN
All right, John, where do we start?

JOHN
How about Delaware? It's a sad thing to find her on the wrong side after al this time. Is there any news of Rodney?

FRANKLIN (pointing)
McKean's back.

JOHN
Thomas!

They go to him.

THOMSON
... a committee formed to study the causes of our military defeat in Canada, designated as the Military Defeat Committee ...

JOHN
How did you leave Caesar? Is he still alive?

@McKean
Aye, but the journey to Dover was fearful hard on him. He never complained, but I could see the poor man was sufferin',

FRANKLIN
But you got him safely home.

@McKean
I did, but I doubt he'll ever set foot out of it again.

JOHN
That leaves you and Read split down the middle, Will he come over?

@McKean
I don't know. He's a stubborn little snot!

JOHN
Then work on him, Keep at him til you wear him down!

@McKean
Och, John, face facts, will y'? If it were just Read standin' in our way it wouldn't be so bad. But look for yourself, man—
(indicating the tally board)
—-Mary-land, Pennsylvania, the entire South—- it's impossible!

JOHN
It's imposible if we al stand around complaining about it. To work, McKean—one foot in front of the other.

FRANKLIN
I believe I put it a better way: “Never leave off til tomorrow that which you can do—”

JOHN
Shut up, Franklin!

@McKean
But what good will it do? Y'know Dickinson— he'll never give in! And y'haven't heard the last of Rutledge yet, either.

JOHN
Never mind about them. Your job is George Read. Talk him deaf if you have to, but bring us back Delaware!

@McKean
There's a simpler way.
(He holds up his rifle.)
This'll break the tie!
(He goes to talk to Read.)

FRANKLIN
All right, John, who's next?

Again they turn to study the board.

THOMSON
... a committee formed to keep secrets, designated as the Secrets Committee ...

JOHN
Pennsylvania and Maryland. I suggest you try to put your own house in order while I take a crack at Old Bacon Face
(look at him stuff himself!)
Mr. Chase!
(He goes to him.)
How about it, Chase? When are you coming to your senses?

CHASE (sourly)
Please, Mr. Adams—not while I'm eating!

FRANKLIN (drawing Wilson aside)
Mr. Wilson, it's time to assert yourself. When you were a judge, how in hell did you ever make a decision?

WILSON
The decisions I made were al based on legality and precedence. But there is no legality here— and certainly no precedent.

FRANKLIN
Because it's a new idea, you clot! We'll be setting our own precedent!

READ (arguing with McKean)
No, Mr. McKean—no, no, no!

@McKean
Damn y'r eyes, Read, y'came into this world screamin' “no,” and y're determined to leave it the same way, y'little worm!

JOHN (with Chase)
The Congress is waiting on you, Chase— America's waiting—the whole world is waiting! What's that, kidney?

He takes a morsel of food from Chase's plate with his fingers, but Chase slaps his hand and he drops it.

CHASE
Leave me alone, Mr. Adams, you're wasting your time. H I thought we could win this war, I'd be at the front of your ranks. But you must know it's impossible! You've heard General Washington's dispatches, His army has fallen apart.

JOHN
Washington's exaggerating the situation in order to arouse this torpid Congress into action. Why, as Chairman of the War Commitice I can tell you for a fact that the army has never been in better shape! Never have troops been so cheerful! Never have soldiers been morc resolute! Never have discipline and training been more spirited!

The Courier enters, dusty as ever. John winces. 

JOHN
Good God!

The Courier deposits his dispatch on Thomson's desk and goes. Hancock puts down his paper and pounds the gavel.

HANCOCK
May we have your ears, gentlemen? Mr. Thomson has a dispatch.

Everyone turns to listen, Witherspoon is nudged awake.

THOMSON (ringing his bell)
From the Commander, Army of the United Colonies; in New York, dispatch number one thousand, one hundred and fifty-seven. “To the honorable Congress, John Hancock, President. Dear Sir: It is with the utmost despair that I must report to you the confusion and disorder that reign in every department—”

@McNair
Sweet Jesus!

THOMSON
“The Continental soldier is as nothing ever seen in this, or any other, century; he is a misfit, ignorant of hygiene, destructive, disorderly and totally disrespectful of rank, Only this last is understandable as there is an incredible reek of stupidity amongst the officers. The situation is most desperate at the New Jersey Training Ground in New Brunswick where every able-bodied whore— _whore_ — in the Colonies has assembled. There are constant reports of drunkenness, desertion, foul language, naked bathing in the Raritan River, and an epidemic of the French disease. I have declared the town 'off-limits' to all military personnel—with the exception of officers. I beseech the Congress to dispatch the War Committee to this place in the hope of restoring some of the order and dis- cipline we need to survive. Y'r ob'd't—
(Drum roll.)
—G. Washington.”

@McKean
Och! The man would depress a hyena!

HANCOCK
Well, Mr. Adams, you're Chairman of the War Committee. Do y'feel up to whoring, drinking, deserting, and New Brunswick?

WITHERSPOON
There must be some mistake, I have an aunt who lives in New Brunswick!

Laughter.

DICKINSON
You must tel her to keep up the good work!
(Laughter.)
Come, come, Mr. Adams, you must see that it's ‘hopeless. Let us recall General Washington and disband the Continental Army before we are overwhelmed.

JOHN
Oh, yes, the English would like that, wouldn't they?

DICKINSON
Why not ask them yourself? They ought to be here any minute.

Laughter.

RUTLEDGE
And when they hang you, Mr. Adams, I hope you will put in a good word for the rest of us.

A distressed silence,

CHASE
Face facts, Mr. Adams—a handful of drunk and disorderly recruits against the entire British Army, the finest musketmen on earth. How can we win? How can we even hope to survive?

JOHN
Answer me straight, Chase. If you thought we could beat the redcoats, would Mary-land “yea” to independence?

CHASE
Well, I suppose—

JOHN
No supposing, Chase—would you of wouldn't you?

CHASE
Very well, Mr. Adams—yes, we would.

JOHN
Then come with me to New Brunswick and see for yourself!

@McKean
John! Are y'mad?

BARTLETT
Y'heard what Washington said— it's a shambles!

HOPKINS
They're pushin' y'into it, Johnny!

JOHN
What do y'say, Chase?

MORRIS
Go ahead, Sam. It sounds lively as hell up there.

CHASE
All right——why not? And maybe it'l be John Adams who comes to his senses.

JOHN
Mr, President, the War Committee will heed General Washington's request! A party consisting of Mr. Chase, Dr. Franklin, and myself will leave immediately.

HANCOCK
Is that satisfactory with you, Dr. Franklin?

All eyes turn to Franklin, who is asleep again. Hopkins nudges him,

JOHN
Wake up, Franklin, you're going to New Brunswick!

FRANKLIN
Like hell I am. What for?

HOPKINS
The whoring and the drinking.

FRANKLIN (perking up)
Why didn't you say so?

They start out. John driving them ahead of him like a sergeant-major.

JOHN
Come on, Chase, move all that lard! We've no time to lose! Left-right, left-right, left-right—!

And they are gone.

The other liberals then go, leaving only the conservatives, Dickinson looks around, then rises.

DICKINSON
Mr. McNair, all this talk of independence has left a certain foulness in the air.
(Laughter from the conservatives.)
My friends and I would appreciate it if you could open some windows.

@McNair
What about the flies?

DICKINSON (smiling)
The windows, Mr. McNair.

### "Cool, Cool, Considerate Men"

DICKINSON
~Oh, say, do you see what I see? 
~Congress sitting here in sweet serenity. 
~I could cheer.
~The reason's clear:
~For the first time in a year
~Adams isn'there!
~And, look!
~The sun is in the sky,
~The breeze isblowing by,
~And there's not a single fly!
~Oh, sing Hosanna, Hosanna!

CONSERVATIVES
~Hosanna, Hosanna!

DICKINSON
~And it'scool!
~Oh, ye cool, cool conservative men,
~Our like may never ever be seen again. © We have land,
~Cash in hand,
~Self-command,
~Future planned.
~Fortune thrives,
~Society survives,
~In neatly ordered lives
~With well-endowered wives.

As McNair goes to the windows, the clock strikes four. Dickinson takes a deep breath, surveys the Chamber, then sings.

CONSERVATIVES
~Come sing Hosanna, Hosanna!

DICKINSON
~In our breeding and our manner...

CONSERVATIVES
~... We are cool!

DICKINSON
~Come, ye cool, cool considerate set, We'll dance together to the same minuet, To the right, |
~Ever to the right,
~Never to the left,
~Forever to the right,
~Let our creed,
~Be never to exceed,
~Regulated speed,
~No matter what the need!

CONSERVATIVES
~Come sing Hosanna, Hosanna!

DICKINSON
~Emblazoned on our banner Is “Keep Cool!”

The Minuet is led by Dickinson and Rutledge, as the conservatives dance. During this the Courier re-enters and deposits his dispatch, as usual, on Thomson's desk, McNair goes to him, offers him a rum, and he stays.

CONSERVATIVES
~To the right,
~Ever to the right,
~The cool, cool conservative men~-—-Rutledge, Wil- son, Read, Morris, Hall, Livingston, and Hewes among ~them-—elegantly prepare to dance.
~Never to the left, Forever to the right.

DICKINSON
~Hands attach,
~Tightly latch, Everybody match.

THOMSON
~I have a new dispatch...
(Music stops, but the Minuet continues silently. Thomson speaks.)
From the Commander, Army of the United Colonies; in New York, dispatch number one thousand, one hundred and fifty-eight. “To the honorable Congress, John Hancock, President. Dear Sir: I awoke this morning to find that Gen. Howe has landed twenty-five thousand British regulars and Hessian mercenaries on Staten Island and that the fleet, under the command of his brother, Admiral Lord Howe, controls not only the. Hudson and East Rivers, but New York Harbour, which now looks like al of London afloat, I can no longer, in good conscience, withhold from the Congress my certainty that the British' military object at this time is Philadelphia. Happy should I be if I could see the means of preventing them, but at present I confess I do not. Oh, how I wish I had never seen the Continental Army. I would have done better to retire to the back country and live in a wigwam. Y'r ob'd't— 
(Drum roll.)
—G. Washington.”

A short pause; then music begins again and the song continues as if nothing had happened.

CONSERVATIVES
~What we do, we do rationally.

DICKINSON
~We never ever go off half cocked, not we.

CONSERVATIVES
~Why begin,
~Till we know that we can win? 
~And if we cannot win,
~Why bother to begin?

RUTLEDGE
~We say this game's not of our choosing,
~Why should we risk losing?

CONSERVATIVE
~We cool, cool men.

DICKINSON (speaking, still dancing)
Mr. Hancock, you're a man of property—one of us, Why don't you join us in our minuet? Why do you persist in dancing with John Adams? Good Lord, sir, you don't even like him!

HANCOCK
~That is true,
~He annoys-me quite a lot,
~But stil I'd rather trot
~To Mr. Adams' new gavotte.

DICKINSON (speaking, continuing to dance)
But why? For personal glory? For a place in history? Be careful, sir. History will brand him and his followers as traitors!

HANCOCK
Traitors to what, Mr. Dickinson— the British Crown? Or the British half-crown? Fortunately, there are not enough men of property in America to dictate policy.

DICKINSON
Perhaps not, but don't forget that most men with nothing would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor. And that is why they will follow us...

CONSERVATIVES
~... To the right,
~Ever to the right, 
~Never to the left, 
~Forever to the right. 
~Where there's gold,
~A market that will hold, 
~Tradition that is old,
~A reluctance to be bold.

DICKINSON
~I sing Hosanna, Hosanna! 
~In a sane and lucid manner!

CONSERVATIVES
~We are cool!
~And we'll hold
~To our gold,
~Tradition that is old,
~Reluctant to be bold!
~We're the cool, cool considerate men, 
~Whose like may never ever be seen again! 
~With our land,
~Cash in hand,
~Self-command,
~Future planned.
~We say this game's not of our choosing. 
~Why should we risk losing?
  
~We Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool—!
~Cool—_!
~Men!!

They turn and go, leaving only McNair, the Leather Apron, and the Courier in the Chamber. They are sient for a moment,

@McNair
How'd you like to try 'n' borrow a dollar from one o' them? {To the Courier:] Want another rum, Gen'rul?

COURIER
Gen'rul?
(He grins.)
Lord, I ain't even a corp'l.

@McNair
Yeah, well, what's the Army know?
(He pours the the Courier another drink, pours himself and the Leather Apron a pair, selects one of Hancock's good clay pipes, lights it, then bangs with the gavel.)
Sit down, gentlemen. The Chair rules it's too damn hot to work! 
(He occupies one chair, the Courier another, and the Leather Apron still a
third.)
What's it like out there, Gen'rul?

COURIER
You prob'ly know more'n me,

@McNair
Sittin' in here? Sweet Jesus! This is the last place to find out what's goin' on!

LEATHER APRON (to the Courier)
I'm aimin' t'join up!

@McNair
What're you talkin' about? You don't have to join up—you're in the Congress!

LEATHER APRON
What's that got t'do with it?

@McNair
Y'don't see them rushin' off t'get killed, do you? But they sure are great ones f'r sendin' others, I'l tel you that.

COURIER (indicating his chair)
Who sets here?

@McNair
Caesar Rodney of Delaware. Where you from, Gen'rul?

COURIER
Watertown.

@McNair
Where's that?

COURIER
Massachusetts.

@McNair
Well, then, you belong down there.
(He indicates John's chair.)
But be careful; there's somethin' about that chair that makes a man awful noisy. 

The Courier goes to Adams' chair and touches it reverently before he sits.

LEATHER APRON
You seed any fightin'?

COURIER (proudly)
Sure did. I seed my two best friends git shot dead on the very same day! Right on the village green it was, too! 
(The recollection takes hold.)
An' when they didn't come home f'r supper, their mommas went down the hil lookin' for 'em.
(Music in, softly.)
Miz Lowell, she foun' Tim'thy right off, but Miz Pickett, she looked near half the night f'r Will'm cuz he'd gone 'n' crawled off the green 'fore he died.

He is silent for a moment; then he sings.

### "Momma, Look Sharp"

COURIER
~Momma, hey, Momma, 
~Come lookin' for me. 
~I'm here in the meadow 
~By the red maple tree. 
~Momma, hey, Momma, 
~Look sharp-—here I be. 
~Hey, Hey-—
~Momma, look sharp!
~Them so'jurs, they fired,
~Oh, Ma, did we run.
~But then we turned round 
~An' the battle begun. 
~Then I went under— 
~Oh,. Ma, am Idone? 
~Hey, Hey-—
~Momma, look sharp!
~My eyes are wide open, 
~My face to the sky.
~Is that you I'm hearin' 
~In the tal grass nearby? 
~Momma, come find me Before I do die.
~Hey, Hey
~Momma, look sharp!

COURIER, MCNAIR, AND LEATHER APRON: 
~I'l close y'r eyes, my Billy,
~Them eyes that cannot see,
~An' I'll bury ya, my Billy,
~Beneath the maple tree,

COURIER
(as McNair and Leather Apron hum quietly)
~An' never ag'in
~Will y'whisper t'me, 
~“Hey, Hey—~”
~Oh, Momma, look sharp!

The lights fade.

# Act 2

INT Scene 6 An anteroom off the main Congressional Chamber. 

At rise, the stage remains dark from the previous scene as the sounds of Congress in session are heard first, Thomson's bell for attention.

HANCOCK
The Secretary will now read the report of the Declaration Committee, Mr. Thomson.

THOMSON
“A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America in General Congress assembled,”

Lights come up on the anteroom. It is deserted save for Jefferson,.who stands by the door into the Chamber, holding it ajar so he can listen to Thomson read his Declaration.

THOMSON
“When in the Course of Human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation, We hold these Truths to be self- evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights—”

Jefferson, having heard a sound offstage, closes the door, silencing Thomson's voice. John and Franklin enter from the wings, wearing capes and hats.

JOHN
Jefferson! We're back and we've got Mary-land— that is, we will, soon as Chase gets through telling the Mary-land Assembly what we saw in New Brunswick!

FRANKLIN
He's in Annapolis right now, describing a ragtag collection of provincial militiamen who couldn't train together, drill together, or march together-— but when a flock of ducks flew by and they saw
their first dinner in three full days, sweet Jesus! Could they shoot together! It was a slaughter!

JEFFERSON (not listening)
They're reading the Declaration.

JOHN
What? How far have they got?

JEFFERSON
“... to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.”

John opens the door to the Chamber.

THOMSON
"...independent of and superior to—”

John closes the door. The three men pace for a moment.

JOHN
Well, there's nothing to fear. It's a masterpiece! I'm to be congratulated.

FRANKLIN
You?

JOHN
For making him write it.

FRANKLIN
Ah, yes-—of course.

They are silent for amoment; then...

JOHN
~It's a masterpiece, I say.
~They will cheer ev'ry word, Ev'ry letter!

JEFFERSON
~I wish Ifelt that way.

FRANKLIN
~I believe I can put it better!
~Now then, attend,
~As friend to friend,
~Our Declaration Committee— 
~For us I see
~Immortality...

ALL
~In Philadelphia city.

FRANKLIN
~A farmer,
~A lawyer, 
~And a sage!l——
~A bit gouty in the leg.
~You know, it's quite bizarre 
~To think that here we are,
~Playing midwives to 
~An egg,

JOHN
Egg? What egg?

FRANKLIN
America—the birth of a new nation!

JEFFERSON
If only we could be sure what kind of a bird it's going to be.

FRANKLIN
Tom's got a point. What sort of a bird should we choose as the symbol of our new America?

JOHN
The eagle.

JEFFERSON
The dove.

FRANKLIN
The turkey.

John and Jefferson look at Franklin in surprise, then at each other.

JOHN
The eagle!

JEFFERSON
The dove.

JOHN
The eagle!

JEFFERSON (shrugging)
The eagle.

A pause.

FRANKLIN
The turkey.

JOHN
The eagle is a majestic bird.

FRANKLIN
The eagle is a scavenger, a thief, a coward, and the symbol of more than ten centuries of European mischief,

JOHN:
And the turkey?

FRANKLIN
A truly noble bird, a native of America, a source of sustenance to our settlers, and an incredibly brave fellow
(kettle drums)
who would not flinch from attacking an entire regiment of Englishmen singlehandedly! Therefore the national bird of America is going to be

drums out

JOHN
The eagle.

FRANKLIN AND JEFFERSON (shrugging)
The eagle.

A pause.

### "The Egg"

JOHN
~We're waiting for the...

ALL
~Chirp! chirp! chirp!
~Of an eaglet being born,
~Waiting for the
~Chirp! chirp! chirp!
~On this humid Monday morning in this 
~Congressional incubator!

FRANKLIN
~God knows, the temp'rature's hot enough 
~To hatch a stone, -
~Let alone
~An egg!

JOHN
~We're waiting for the...

ALL
~Scratch! scratch! scratchl
~Of that tiny little fellow,
~Waiting for the egg to hatch,
~On this humid Monday morning in this 
~Congressional incubator!

JOHN
~God knows the temp'rature's hot enough To hatch astone!

JEFFERSON
~But will it hatch
~An egg?

JOHN
The Declaration will be a triumph, I tel you— a triumph! If I was ever sure of anythinIg'm sure of that— a triumph!
(A pause.)
And if it isn't, we've stil got four days left to think ofsomething else.
  
~The eagle's going to
~Crack the shell
~Of the egg that England laid!

ALL
~Yessir! We can
~Tell! tel! tel!
~On this humid Monday morning in this 
~Congressional incubator!

FRANKLIN
~And just as Tom, here, has written,
~Though the shell may belong to Great Britain, 
~The eagle inside
~Belongs to us!

ALL
~And just as Tom, here, has written, 
~We say “To hell with Great Britain!” 
~The eagle inside
~Belongs to us!!!

They turn and go confidently into the Chamber.

Int. Scene 7 The Chamber

Congress is in session—Hancock, Bartlett, Hopkins, Sherman, Morris, Livingston, Witherspoon, Dickinson, Wilson, McKean, Read, Hewes, Rutledge, and Hall being present—and now John, Franklin, and Jefferson take their places, this action continuing from the previous scene, as Thomson completes his reading of the Declaration. The calendar on the wall now reads: “JUNE 28.”

## June 28

THOMSON
"... and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do al other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Dec- laration we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.”

Finished, he looks up. Nobody moves, nobody speaks, nobody reacts; the silence is compiete and prolonged.

HANCOCK (finally)
Very well. Thank you, Mr. Thomson. The Congress has heard the report of the Declaration Committee. Are there any who wish to offer amendments, deletions, or alterations to the Declaration?

Suddenly every hand but John's, Franklin's, Jefferson's, and Hopkins' shoots up.

CONGRESS
Mr. President!
Hear me, Mr. President!
I've got one! Over here!
(Et cetera.)

HANCOCK (pounding the gavel for order)
Gentlemen, please! McNair, you'd better open the window. Colonel McKean, I saw your hand first.

@McKean
Mr. Jefferson, it's a bonny paper y've written, but somewhere in it y've mentioned “Scottish and foreign mercenaries sent t'destroy us.” Scottish, Tom?

JOHN
It's in reference to a Highland regiment which stood against us at Boston.

@McKean
Och, it was more likely Germans wearin' kilts to disguise their bein' there. I ask y'to remove the word and avoid givin' offense to a good people.

THOMSON
Mr. Jefferson?

Jefferson nods and Thomson scratches his quill pen through the word. The many hands go up again.

HANCOCK
The Reverend Witherspoon?

WITHERSPOON
Mr. Jefferson, nowhere do you mention the Su- preme Being. Certainly this was an oversight, for how could we hope to achieve a victory without His help? Therefore I must humbly suggest the following addition to your final sentence: “With a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence.”

Again Thomson looks at Jefferson, who in turn looks at John; the two patriots shrug, then Jefferson turns back to Thomson and nods; the phrase is added. More hands.

HANCOCK
Mr. Read?

READ
Among your charges against the King, Mr. Jefferson, you accuse him of depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury. This is untrue, sir. In Delaware we have always had trial by jury.

JOHN
In Massachusetts we have not.

READ
Oh. Then I suggest that the words “in many cases” be added.

THOMSON
Mr. Jefferson?

And again Jefferson nods; the words are added,

@McKean
“In many cases!”—-och, brilliant! I s'pose every time y'see those three words y'r puny little chest'll swell up wi pride over y'r great historical contribution!

READ
It's more memorable than your unprincipled whitewash of that race of barbarians!

HANCOCK (pounding the gavel)
Mr. Read, Colonel McKean—-that's enough!
(The hands are raised, this time Hopkins' among them.)
Mr. Hopkins?

HOPKINS
No objections, Johnny, I'm just trying to get a drink.

HANCOCK
I should've known. McNair, get him a rum.

Again the hands go up.

## June 29

McNair crosses to the wall calendar and removes a leaf, uncovering “June 29.”

HANCOCK
Mr. Bartlett?

BARTLETT
Mr. Jefferson, I beg you to remember that we stil have friends in England. I see no purpose in antagonizing them with such phrases as “unfeeling brethren” and “enemics in war.” Our quarrel is with the British King, not the British people.

JOHN
Be sensible, Bartlett. Remove those phrases, and the entire paragraph becomes meaningless. And it so happens it's among the most stirring and poetic of any passage in the entire document.

He picks up the Declaration from Thomson's desk, preparing to read

BARTLETT
We're a Congress, Mr. Adams, not a literary society. I ask that the entire paragraph be stricken.

THOMSON
Mr. Jefferson?

And again, after some thought this time, and with some sadness, Jefferson nods.

JOHN
Good God, Jefferson! Don't you ever intend to speak up for your own work?

JEFFERSON
I had hoped that the work would speak for itself,

Thomson scratches out the paragraph.

@McNair
Mr. Hancock.

HANCOCK
What is it, Mr. McNair?

@McNair
I can't say I'm very fond of the United States of Amcrica as a name for a new country.

HANCOCK
I don't care what you're fond of, Mr. McNair, You're not a member of this Congress! Mr. Sherman?

SHERMAN (coffee in hand, as usual)
Brother Jefferson, I noted at least two distinct and direct references to the British Parliament in your Declaration. Do you think it's wise to alienate that august body in light of our contention that they have never had any direct authority over us any way?

JOHN
This is a revolution, dammit! We're going to have to offend somebody!

FRANKLIN
John.
(He leads John downstage as the debate in the Chamber continues silently behind them.)
John, you'll have an attack of apoplexy if you're not careful.

JOHN
Have you heard what they're doing to it? Have you heard?

FRANKLIN
Yes, John, I've heard, but-—

JOHN
And so far it's only been our friends? Can you imagine what our enemies will do?

HANCOCK
The word “Parliament” will be removed wherever it occurs.

JOHN
They won't be satisfied until they remove one of the Fs from Jefferson's name.

FRANKLIN
Courage, John! It won't last much longer.

They start back toward their seats as the hands go up again,

And again McNair goes to the calendar and removes another page; it now reads; “JUNE 30.”

## June 30

HANCOCK
Mr. Dickinson?

DICKINSON
Mr. Jefferson, I have very litle interest in your paper, as there is no doubt in my mind that we have all but heard the fast of it, But I am curious about one thing: why do you refer to King George as a tyrant?

JEFFERSON
Because he is a tyrant.

DICKINSON
I remind you, Mr. Jefferson, that this “tyrant” is still your King.

JBFFERSON
When a king becomes a tyrant he thereby breaks the contract binding his subjects to him.

DICKINSON
How so?

JEFFERSON
By taking away their rights.

DICKINSON
Rights that came from him in the first place.

JEFFERSON
All except one—the right to be free comes from nature.

DICKINSON
Mr. Wilson, do we in Pennsylvania consider King George a tyrant?

WILSON
Mmm? Well--I don't know.
(As he meets Dickinson's stone stare)
Oh. No—no, we don't. He's not a tyrant—in Pennsylvania.

DICKINSON
There you are, Mr. Jefferson. Your Declaration does not speak for us all. I demand the word “tyrant” be removed!

Thomson begins scratching it out.

JEFFERSON
Just a moment, Mr. Thomson, I do not consent. The King is a tyrant whether we say so or not. We might as well say so.

THOMSON
But I already scratched itout.

JEFFERSON (forcefuliy)
Then scratch it back in!

A surprised silence.

HANCOCK (finally)
Put it back, Mr. Thomson. The King will remain a tyrant. 

Once more McNair goes to the calendar and changes the date—to “JULY 1.”

## July 1

HANCOCK
Mr. Hewes?

HEWES
Mr. Jefferson, nowhere do you mention deep-sea fishin' rights. We in North

Everyone throws up his hands in disgust and impatience.

JOHN
Good God! Fishing rights! How long is this piddling to go on? We have been sitting here for three full days. We have endured, by my count, eighty- five separate changes and the removal of close to four hundred words. Would you whip it and beat it til you break its spirit? I tel you this document is a masterful expression of the American mind!

There is a silence.

HANCOCK
If there are no more changes, then, I can assume that the report of the Declaration Committee has been-—.

RUTLEDGE (deliberately)
Just a moment, Mr. President.

FRANKLIN (to John)
Look out.

RUTLEDGE
I wonder if we could prevail upon Mr. Thomson to read again a small portion of Mr. Jefferson's Declaration— the one beginnin' “He has waged cruel war—”?

HANCOCK
Mr. Thomson?

THOMSON (reading back rapidly to himself)
“... He has affected... He has combined . . He has abdicated ...He has plundered ...He has constrained ...He has excited ...He has incited ... He has waged cruel war!” Ah,
(He looks up.)
Here it is.
(He clears his throat and reads.)
“He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, in the persons of a distant people who never of- fended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere. Determined to keep open a market where men should be bought and sold, he has prostituted-—”

RUTLEDGE
That will suffice, Mr. Thomson, I thank you. Mr. Jefferson, I can't quite make out what it is you're talkin' about.

JEFFERSON
Slavery, Mr. Rutledge.

RUTLEDGE
Ah, yes. You're referrin' to us as slaves of the King.

JEFFERSON
No, sir, I'm referring to our slaves. Black slaves.

RUTLEDGE
Ah! Black slaves. Why didn't you say so, sir? Were you tryin' to hide your meanin'?

JEFFERSON
No, sir.

RUTLEDGE
Just another literary license, then.-

JEFFERSON
If you like.

RUTLEDGE
I don't like at al, Mr. Jefferson. To us in South Carolina, black slavery is our peculiar institution and a cherished way of life.

JEFFERSON
Nevertheless, we must abolish it. Nothing is more certainly written in the Book of Fate than that this people shall be free.

RUTLEDGE
I am not concerned with the Book of Fate right now, sir. I am more concerned with what's written in your litle paper there.

JOHN
That “little paper there” deals with freedom for Americans!

RUTLEDGE
Oh, really! Mr. Adams is now callin' our black slaves Americans, Are-they-now?

JOHN
They are! They're people and they're here—if there is any requirement, I've never heard of it.

RUTLEDGE
They are here, yes, but they are not people, sir, they are property.

JEFFERSON
No, sir! They are people who are being treated as property. I tell you the rights of human nature are deeply wounded by this infamous practice!

RUTLEDGE (shouting)
Then see to your own wounds, Mr. Jefferson, for you are a—-practitioner, are you not?

A pause, Rutledge has found the mark.

JEFFERSON
I have already resolved to release my slaves.

RUTLEDGE
Then I'm sorry, for you have also resolved the ruination of your personal economy.

JOHN
Economy. Always economy. There's more to this than a filthy purse-string, Rutledge. It's an offense against man and God.

HOPKINS
It's a stinking busincss, Mr. Rutledge—a stinking business!

RUTLEDGE
Is it really, Mr. Hopkins? Then what's that I smell floatin' down from the North—could it be the aroma of hy-pocrisy? For who holds the other end of that filthy purse-string, Mr. Adams?
(To every- one)
Our northern brethren are feclin' a bit tender toward our slaves. They don't keep slaves, no-o, but they're willin' to be considerable carriers of slaves—to others! They are willin', for the shillin'
(rubbing his thumb and forefinger together)
or haven't y'heard, Mr. Adams? Clink! Clink!

He sings.

### "Molasses to Rum"

RUTLEDGE
~Molasscs to
~Rum to
~Slaves!
~Oh, what a beautiful waltz!
~You dance with us, 
~We dance with you, in 
~Molasses and
~Rum and
~Slaves!
(Afro-rhythm.)
~Who sail the ships out of Boston, 
~Laden with Bibles and Rum? 
~Who drinks a toast
~To the Ivory Coast,
~“Hail, Africa! The slavers have come.” 
~New England, with Bibles and Rum!
  
~Then,
~It's off with the Rum and the Bibles 
~Take on the Slaves, clink! clink! 
~Then,
~Hail and farewell!
~To the smell of the African
~Coast!
  
~Molasses to
~Rum to
~Slaves!
~'Tisn't morals, 'tis money that saves! 
~Shall we dance to the sound
~Of the profitable pound, in 
~Molasses and
~Rum and
~Slaves!
  
~Who sail the ships out of Guinca,
~Laden with Bibles and Slaves?
~'Tis Boston can boast
~To the West Indies coast
~“Jamaica! We brung what y'craves! 
~Antigua! Barbados!
~We brung Bibles 
~And Slaves!”
(He speaks, Afro-rhythm continues.)
Gentlemen! You mustn't think our northern friends merely see our slaves as figures on a ledger. Oh, no, sir! They see them as figures on the block! Notice the faces at the auctions, gentlemen—white faces on the African wharves-—New England faces, seafaring faces: “Put them in the ships, cram them in the ships, stuff them in the ships!” Hurry, gentlemen, let the auction begin!
  
~Ya-ha ...
~Ya-ha... ha-ma-ha-cundahhh!
  
Gentlemen, do y' hear?
That's the cry of the auctioneer!
  
~Ya-ha...
~Ya-ha ... ha-ma-ha-cundahhh!
  
Slaves, gentlemen! Black gold, livin' gold—-gold!
~From:
~Annn-go-laah!
~Guinea-Guinea-Guinea!
~Blackbirds for sale!
  
Aaa-shan-tiiii!
Ibo! Ibo! Ibo! Ibo!
  
~Blackbirds for sale!
Handle them!
Fondle them!
But don't finger them! 
~They're prime, they're prime!
  
~Ya-ha...
~Ya-ha ... ha-ma-ha-cundabhh!

Music stops.

BARTLETT (pleading)
For the love of God, Mr. Rutledge, please!

Music resumes.

RUTLEDGE
~Molasses to
~Rum to Slaves!
~Who sail the ships back to Boston, 
~Laden with gold, see it gleam? 
~Whose fortunes are made
~In the triangle trade?
~Hail, Slavery, the New England Dream!
~Mr. Adams, I give you a toast! 
~Hail, Boston!
~Hail, Charleston!
~Who stinketh the most?!

He turns and walks straight out of the Chamber, Hewes of North Caroiina follows, and Hall of Georgia is right behind them.

JOHN (desperate)
Mr. Rutledge! Mr. Hewes! Dr. Halll

Hall, the last, hesitates at the door as his name is called. He turns, looks at John, starts to say something, then turns and goes after the others.

WITHERSPOON
Don't worry, they'll be back,

@McKean
Aye—-t'vote us down.

There is a silence. Then Chase bursts into the Chamber.

CHASE (elated)
It's done! Adams, Franklin— I have it! And the Mary-land Assembly's approved it! I told them about one of the greatest military engagements in history, against a flock of--
(He runs down as the news is greeted with less enthusiasm than expected, and he sees the glum faces.)
What's wrong? Ithought—

DICKINSON (cordially)
You'll have to forgive them, Mr. Chase, they've just suffered a slight set back. And after al, what is a man profited, if he shall gain Mary-land, and lose the entire South?
(Smiling as he goes)
Matthew, chapter sixteen, verse twenty-six.

Wilson, Read, Livingston, and Morris follow him out. Chase joins the ranks of the depressed as Thomson moves Maryland into the “Yea” column.

HANCOCK (lifelessly)
Mr. McNair-—

@McNair
I know, the flies.

HANCOCK
No—a rum,

JOHN (surveying the sorry sight)
Well? What're you al sitting around for? We're wasting precious time! 
(To McKean.)
Thomas! I want you to ride down into Delaware and fetch back Caesar Rodney!

@McKean
John! Are y'mad? It's eighty miles on horseback, an' he's a dyin' man!

JOHN
No! He's a patriot!

@McKean
Och, John, what good'll it do? The South's done us in.

JOHN
And suppose they change their minds—can we get Delaware without Rodney?

@McKean (shaking his head)
God! What a bastardly bunch we are!

He goes.

JOHN (turning to Hopkins)
Stephen—

HOPKINS
I'm goin' to the tavern, Johnny. If there's any- thing I can do for y'there, let me know.

He goes.

JOHN
Chase, Bartlett—

BARTLETT
What's the use, John? The vote's tomorrow morning.

CHASE
There's less than a full day left!

They go.

JOHN
Roger!

SHERMAN
Face facts, John—-it's finished!

WITHERSPOON
I'm sorry, John.

And they go.

John looks around, stunned by the defection.

Only Franklin, Jefferson, Hancock, and Thomson remain,

FRANKLIN
We've no other choice, John. The slavery clause has to go.

JOHN
Franklin, what are y'saying?

FRANKLIN
It's a luxury we can't afford.

JOHN
A luxury? A half-million souls in chains and Dr. Franklin calls it a luxury! Maybe you should've walked out with the South!

FRANKLIN
You forget yourself, sir! I founded the first anti-
slavery society on this continent!

JOHN
Don't wave your credentials at me! Perhaps it's time you had them renewed!

FRANKLIN (angrily)
The issue here is independence! Maybe you've lost sight of that fact, but I have not! How dare you jeopardize our cause when we've come so far? These men, no matter how much we disagree with them, are not ribbon clerks to be ordered about; they're proud, accomplishcd men, the cream of their colonies—-and whether you like it or not, they and the people they represent will be a part of the new country you'd hope to create! Either start fearning how to live with them or pack up and go home—but in any case, stop acting like a Boston fishwife!

And he leaves John alone, returning upstage to join Jefferson.

John turns and comes downstage.

JOHN
Good God, what's happened to me? John Adams, the great John Adams, Wise Man of the East— what have I come to? My law practice down the the pipe, my farm mortgaged to the hilt—at a stage in life when other men prosper I'm reduced to living in Philadelphia.
(Abigail appears, as before.)
Oh, Abigail, what am I going to do?

ABIGAIL
Do, John?

JOHN
I need your help.

ABIGAIL
You don't usually ask my advice.

JOHN
Yes—well, there doesn't appear to be anyone else right now.

ABIGAIL (sighing)
Very well, John, what is it?


JOHN
The entire South has walked out of this Congress, George Washington is on the verge of total anni-
hilation, the precious cause for which I've labored these several years has come to nothing, and it
seems—[a pause}-—it seems Iam obnoxious and disliked.

ABIGAIL
Nonsense, John.

JOHN
That I am unwilling to face reality.

ABIGAIL
Foolishness, John.

JOHN
That I am pig-headed.

ABIGAIL (smiling)
Ah, well, there you have me, John. I'm afraid you are pig-headed.

He smiles; a pause.

JOHN
Has it been any kind of a life for you, Abby? God knows I haven't given you much.

ABIGAIL
I never asked for more. After all, I am Mrs, John Adams—that's quite a lot for one lifetime.

JOHN (bitterly)
Is it, Abby?

ABIGAIL
Think of it, John! To be married to the man who is always first in line to be hanged!

JOHN
Yes. The ag-i-ta-tor.
(Turning to her)
Why, Abby? You must tell me what it is! I've always been dissatisfied, I know that; but lately I find that I reek of discontentment! It fils my throat and floods my brain, and sometimes—sometimes I fear that there is no longer a dream, but only the discontentment.

ABIGAIL
Oh, John, can you really know so little about yourself? And can you think so litle of me that you'd believe I married the man you've described? Have you forgotten what you used to say to me? I haven't. “Commitment, Abby—commitment! There are only two creatures of value on the face of this earth: those with a commitment, and those who require the commitment of others.”
(A pause.)
Do you remember, John?

JOHN (nodding)
I remember.

McNair enters, carrying two gaily beribboned kegs, and thumps them down in front of John.

@McNair
Mr. Adams-—

JOHN
What?

@McNair
These're for you.

JOHN
Just a minute—what are they? What's in them? Who sent them?

### "Compliments"
Music in, glissando.

ABIGAIL
~Compliments of the Concord Ladies' Coffee Club, 
~And the Sisterhood of the Truro Synagogue,
~And the Friday Evening Baptist Sewing Circle, 
~And the Holy Christian Sisters of Saint Clare— 
~All for you, John!
~I am, as I ever was, and ever shall be...
~Yours...
~Yours... 
~Yours... 
~Yours--

JOHN
Just a moment, Abigail—what's in those kegs?

ABIGAIL (singing triumphantly)
Saltpetre, John!

She blows a kiss and goes

John turns back to the Chamber.

JOHN
McNair! Go out and buy every damned pin in Philadelphia!

@McNair
Pin? What sort of pin?

JOHN
I don't know—~whatever ladies use with their sewing! And take these kegs to the armory——hurry, man!
(Turning as McNair goes)
Franklin, Jeffer- son, what are you just sitting around for?

FRANKLIN
John! I'm not even speaking to you!

JOHN
Never mind that. Here's what you've got to do—

FRANKLIN
John, didn't you hear a word that I said before?

JOHN
It's too late for that dammit! 
(Music in, vigorously.)
There's work to be done!

### "Is Anybody There?"
JOHN
~Time's running out! 
~Get up!
~Get out of your chair!
~Tomorrow is here.
~Too late,
~Too late to despair!
  
Jefferson! Talk to Rutledge, talk! If it takes all night, Keep talking.

JOHN AND JEFFERSON:
Talk and talk and talk!

JOHN
You're both Southern aristocrats—-gentlemen, If he'll listen to anybody, he'll listen to you!
~Franklin!
~Time's running out!

FRANKLIN
I know. Get out of my chair!
Do I have to talk to Wilson?

JOHN
Yes, yes, you do!
If it takes all night, Keep talking!

JOHN, FRANKLIN, AND JEFFERSON
Talk and talk and talk!

JOHN
Get him away from Dickinson, that's the only way to do it!

Franklin and Jefferson go. Music under.

HANCOCK (coming forward)
I'm still from Massachusetts, John; you know where I stand. I'l do whatever you say.

JOHN (considering)
No, you're the President of Congress, You're a fair man, Hancock-——stay that way.

The Courier enters and stops short as he comes face to face with John, who takes his dispatch and crosses up to Thomson's desk, where he hands it to the Secretary.

JOHN
Tell me, Mr. Thomson, out of curiosity, do you stand with Mr. Dickinson, or do you stand with me?

THOMSON (holding up the dispatch)
I stand with the General. Lately—I've had the oddest feeling that he's been writing to _me_.

He reads, singing.

THOMSON
~“I have been in expectation
~Of receiving a reply
~On the subject of my last fifteen dispatches. Isanybody there?
~Does anybody care?
~Does anybody care?
~Y'r humble & ob'd't—”

Drum roll; then it rans down as Thomson, unable to read the signature, rises and goes, thoroughly discouraged.

It is growing dark outside. Hancock stands by the door, watching John, concerned,

HANCOCK
Are y'hungry, John?

JOHN
No, I think I'll stay.

HANCOCK
G'night, then.

He goes

John looks around the Chamber, then goes to Thomson's desk and picks up the dispatch.

JOHN
~“Is anybody there? 
~Does anybody care?”

He drops the dispatch.

JOHN
~Does anybody see what I see?
  
~They want me to quit,
~They say, “John, give up the fight!” 
~Still to England I say:
~“Good night forever, good night!”
  
~For I have crossed the Rubicon,
~Let the bridge be burn'd behind me! 
~Come what may, come what may... 
~Commitment!
~The croakers all say 
~We'll rue the day, 
~There'll be hell to pay in 
~Fiery Purgatory!
  
~Through all the gloom,
~Through all the gloom, Ican
~See the rays of ravishing light and 
~Glory!
  
~Is anybody there?! 
~Does anybody care?! 
~Does anybody see 
~What I see?!
  
~I see
~Fireworks!
~I see the Pageant and Pomp and Parade!
~I hear the bells ringing out 
~I hear the cannons' roar!
  
~I see Americans, all Americans,
~Free! For evermore!
(He “comes to' and looks around, realizing that it's dark and that he's alone.)
~How quiet...
~How quiet the Chamber is. ...
~How silent...
~How silent the Chamber is. ...
  
~Is anybody there—?
(He waits for an answer; there is none. )
~Does anybody care—?
(Again, nothing.)
~Does anybody see—what Isee?

Music out.

HALL
Yes, Mr. Adams, Ido.

John turns and discovers the Georgia delegate standing by the door, in the shadows.

JOHN
Dr. Hall, Ididn't know anyone was-—

HALL
I'm sorry if I startled you. I couldn't sleep. In trying to resolve my dilemma I remembered something I'd once read— “that a representative owes the People not only his industry, but his judgment, and he betrays them if he sacrifices it to their opinion.” 
(He smiles.)
It was written by Edmund Burke, a member of the British Parliament.

He walks to the tally board and moves the name of Georgia from the “Nay” to the “Yea” column. The two men regard each other for a moment.

### The Vote

It has been growing light outside and now the clock, offstage, chimes ten and the. men of the Congress return silently, in single file, each with his own private thoughts, McKean supporting Rod- ney at the end.

Then Hancock pounds the gavel.

HANCOCK
Very well. The Congress will now vote on Virginia's resolution on independence.
(To Rodney)
Thank you for coming, Caesar. And God bless you, sit.
(Foot-stamping and other signs of approval from all,)
Call the roll, Mr. Thomson. And I'd remind you, gentlemen, that a single “Nay” vote will defeat the motion. Mr. Thomson?

Thomson goes to the tally board. During the following, Franklin is deeply engaged.in silent argument with Dickinson and Wilson, their heads remaining together.

THOMSON (droning)
New Hampshire—

BARTLETT
New Hampshire says “Yea.”

THOMSON
New Hampshire says “Yea,” Massachusetts—

JOHN
Massachusetts says “Yea.”

THOMSON
Massachusetts says “Yea.” Rhode Island—

HOPKINS
Rhode Island says “Yea.”

THOMSON
Rhode Island says “Yea.” Connecticut

SHERMAN
Connecticut says “Yea.”

THOMSON
Connecticut says “Yea.” New York—

MORRIS
New York abstains—-courteously.

THOMSON
New York abstains.

MORRIS (disgusted and ashamed)
Courteously.

THOMSON
New Jersey-—

WITHERSPOON
New Jersey says “Yea.”

THOMSON
New Jersey says “Yea.” Pennsylvania—
(As no one responds)
Pennsylvania? 

FRANKLIN
Mr. Secretary, Pennsylvania isn't ready yet. Come back to us later. 

He returns to the argument.

THOMSON
Pennsylvania passes, Delaware-—

RODNEY (as McKean helps him to his feet)
Delaware, by majority vote-—

@McKean
Aye!

RODNEY
—says “Yea.”

FRANKLIN
Well done, sir.

THOMSON
Delaware says “Yea.”
(And Delaware's marker on the tally board is moved into the “Yea” column.)
Mary-land—

CHASE
Mary-land says “Yea.”

THOMSON
Mary-land says “Yea.” Virginia—

JEFFERSON
Virginia says “Yea.”

THOMSON
Virginia says “Yea.” North Carolina—

HEWES
North Carolina yields to South Carolina!

THOMSON
South Carolina-—

RUTLEDGE (rising, then turning to John)
Well, Mr. Adams?

JOHN (returning his stare)
Well, Mr. Rutledge?

RUTLEDGE
Mr. Adams, you must believe that I will do what I have promised to do.

A pause,

JOHN
What do y'want, Rutledge?

RUTLEDGE
Remove the offendin' passage from your Declaration.

JOHN
If we did that we'd be guilty of what we ourselves are rebelling against.

RUTLEDGE
Nevertheless, remove it or South Carolina will bury now and forever your dream of independence.

FRANKLIN (imploring)
John, I beg you to consider what you're doing.

JOHN
Mark me, Franklin, if we give in on this issue, posterity wili never forgive us.

FRANKLIN
That's probably true. But we won't hear a thing, John-—we'll be long gone, And besides, what will posterity think we were—demigods? We're men— no more, no less—trying to get a nation started against greater odds than a more generous God would have allowed. John, first things first! Independence! America! For if we don't secure that, what difference will the rest make?

JOHN (looking around, uncertain)
Jefferson, say something.

JEFFERSON
What else is there to do?

JOHN
Well, man, you're the one who wrote it!

JEFFERSON
I wrote _all_ of it, Mr. Adams!

He goes to Thomson's table, takes up the quill pen, and scratches the passage from the Declaration. Then he returns to his seat.

John snatches up the Declaration, goes to Rut- ledge, and waves It under his nose.

JOHN
There! There it is, Rutledge! You've got your slavery, and little good may it do you! Now vote, damn you!

RUTLEDGE (unruffied)
Mr, Secretary, the fair colony of South Carolina says “Yea.”

THOMSON
South Carolina says “Yea.”

HEWES (jumping up)
North Carolina says “Yea!”

THOMSON
North Carolina says “Yea,”
(The two markers on the tally board are moved out of the “Nay” column. Only Pennsylvania remains there.)
Georgia.

HALL
Georgia says “Yea.”

THOMSON
Georgia says “Yea.” Pennsylvania, second call-——

DICKINSON
Mr. President, Pennsylvania regrets all of the inconvenience that such distinguished men as Adams, Franklin, and Jefferson were put to just now. They might have kept their document in tact, for all the difference it will make. Mr. President, Pennsylvania says—

FRANKLIN
Just a moment! I ask that the delegation be polled.

DICKINSON
Dr. Franklin, don't be absurd!

FRANKLIN
A poll, Mr. President. It's a proper request.

HANCOCK
Yes, it is. Poll the delegation, Mr. Thomson.

THOMSON
Dr. Benjamin Franklin-—

FRANKLIN
Yea!

THOMSON
Mr. John Dickinson—

DICKINSON
Nay!

THOMSON
Mr. James Wilson-—-
(As there is no response)
Judge Wilson?

All eyes turn to Wilson.

FRANKLIN
There it is, Mr. Wilson, it's up to you now—the whole question of American independence rests squarely on your shoulders. An entirely new nation, Mr. Wilson, waiting to be born or to die in birth, all on your say-so. Which will it be, Mr. Wilson? Every map-maker in the world is waiting for your decision!

DICKINSON
Come now, James, nothing has changed. We mustn't let Dr. Franklin create one of his confusions. The question is clear.

FRANKLIN
Most questions are clear when someone else has to decide them.

JOHN (quietly, turning the screw)
It would be a pity for a man who handed down hundreds of wise decisions from the bench to be remembered only for the one unwise decision he made in Congress.

DICKINSON
James, you're keeping everybody waiting. The Secretary has called for your vote.

WILSON (to Dickinson)
Please don't push me, John, I know what you want me to do. But Mr. Adams is correct about one thing. I'm the one who'll be remembered for it.

DICKINSON
What do you mean?

WILSON
I'm different from you, John. I'm different from most of the men here. I don't want to be remembered, I just don't want the responsibility!

DICKINSON
Yes, well, whether you want it or not, James, there's no way of avoiding it.

WILSON
Not necessarily. If I go with them, I'll only be one among dozens; no one will ever remember the name of James Wilson. But if I vote with you, I'll be the man who prevented American independence, I'm sorry, John—I just didn't bargain far that.

DICKINSON
And is that how new nations are formed— by a nonentity trying to preserve the anonymity he so richly deserves?

FRANKLIN
Revolutions come into this world like bastard children, Mr. Dickinson-— half improvised and half compromised, Our side has provided the compromise; now Judge Wilson is supplying the rest.

WILSON (to Dickinson)
I'm sorry, John. My vote is “Yea.”

FRANKLIN
Mr. Secretary, Pennsylvania says “Yea.”

THOMSON
Pennsylvania says “Yea.”

There is a stunned silence as all eyes go to the tally board and Pennsylvania's marker is moved into the “Yea” column.

THOMSON
The count being twelve to none with one absten- tion, the resolution on independence—
(surprised)
—is adopted.

JOHN
It's done. It's done.

A pause,

HANCOCK
Mr. Thomson, is the Declaration ready to be signed?

THOMSON
It is.

HANCOCK
Then I suggest we do so. And the Chair further proposes for our mutual security and protection, that no man be allowed to sit in this Congress with out attaching his name to it.

All eyes now go to Dickinson.

DICKINSON
I cannot, in good conscience, sign such a document. I'm sorry, Mr. President, I will never stop hoping for our eventual reconciliation with England. But because, in my own way, I regard America no less than does Mr. Adams, I will join the Army and fight in her defense-—even though I believe that fight to be hopeless. Good-by, gentlemen.

He starts out.

JOHN
Gentlemen of the Congress, I say yea John Dickinson!

Dickinson stops as the members of Congress ex- press their admiration for him by stamping their feet and banging their walking sticks on the floor. Then he goes and Hancock pounds the gavel.

HANCOCK
Gentlemen, are there any objections to the Declaration being approved as it now stands?

JOHN
I have one, Mr. Hancock.

HANCOCK
You, Mr. Adams?

JOHN
Yes. Mr. Jefferson, it so happens the word is un-alienable, not inalienable.

JEFFERSON
I'm sorry, Mr. Adams, inalienable is correct.

JOHN (his voice rising)
I happen to be a Harvard graduate—

JEFFERSON (his voice also rising)
And I attended William and Mary-—~

HANCOCK (pounding the gavel)
Gentlemen, please! Mr. Jefferson, will you yield to Mr. Adams' request?

A pause.

JEFFERSON
No, sir, I will not.

JOHN
Oh, very well, I'll withdraw it,

FRANKLIN
Good for you, John!

JOHN (privately)
I'l speak to the printer about it later.

HANCOCK
Very well, gentlemen. 
(He goes to Thomson's desk and picks up the quill.)
We are about to brave the storm in a skiff made of paper, and how it will end, God only knows. 

He signs with a flourish.

HOPKINS
That's a pretty large signature, Johnny.

HANCOCK
So Fat George in London can read it without his glasses! 
(Laughter.)
All right, gentlemen, step right up, don't miss your chance to commit treason!

Laughter.

FRANKLIN
Hancock's right. This paper is our passport to the gallows. But there's no backing out now. If we don't hang together, we shall most assuredly hang separately. 

Laughter.

@McKean (patting his ample middle)
In any case hanging won't be so bad—one snap and it'l be over-—
(snap)
—just like that! But look at Read, there—he'll be dancing a jig long after I'm gone!

Laughter.

HANCOCK
Gentlemen, forgive me if I don't join in the merri- ment, but if we're arrested now my name is still the only one on the damn thing!

More laughter, which subsides slowly as the Courier enters, deposits his dispatch on Thomson's desk, and departs, turning to glance at John as he goes.

THOMSON
From the Commander, Army of the United Colonies—
(he stops, looks up)
—Army of the United States— in New York, dispatch number one thousand, two hundred and nine. “To the Hon. Congress, John Hancock, President. Dear Sir: I can now report with some certainty that the eve of battle is near at hand. Toward this end I have ordered the evacuation of Manhattan and directed our defenses to take up stronger positions on the Brooklyn Heights. At the present time my forces consist entirely of Hasict's Delaware Militia and Smallwood's Mary-landers, a total of five thousand troops stand against—
(he hesitates in horrified astonishment)
—twenty-five thousand of the enemy —and I begin to notice that many of them are lads under fifteen and old men, none of whom could truly be calicd soldiers. One personal note to Mr. Lewis Morris of New York-—- I must regretfully report that his estates have becn totally destroyed but that I have taken the liberty of transporting Mrs. Morris and eight of the children to Connecticut and safety. The four older boys are now enlisted in the Continental Army. As I write these words, the enemy is plainly in sight beyond the river. How it will end only Providence can direct -—but dear God! what brave men—I shall lose— before this business ends. Y'r ob'd't—
(Drum roll.)
—G. Washington.”

There is a silence, during which McNair goes to the calendar and removes the final leaf, revealing: “JULY 4.”

## July 4

The light outside has dimmed; it is becoming evening.

HANCOCK (finally)
Very well, gentlemen. McNair, go ring the bell.

McNair goes.

MORRIS (rising)
Mr. President!

HANCOCK
Mr. Morris?

MORRIS
To hell with New York-——I'll sign it anyway.

HANCOCK
Thank you, Mr. Morris. Stephen, sit down.

HANCOCK
Very well, Mr, Thomson—

HOPKINS
(who has been standing next to the Declaration on Thomson's desk)
No— I want t'remember each man's face as he signs.

### "Finale"

As each name is called, the signer rises, comes to the Secretary's desk, signs, then stands to one side. The tolling Liberty Bell begins, offstage.

THOMSON (in measured tones)
New Hampshire, Dr. Josiah Bartiett. Massachusetts, Mr. John Adams.
Rhode Island, Mr. Stephen Hopkins. Connecticut, Mr. Roger Sherman.
New York, Mr. Lewis Morris.
New Jersey, the Reverend John Witherspoon. 
Pennsylvania, Dr. Benjamin Franklin.
Delaware, Mr. Caesar Rodney.
(Hancock takes the Declaration to the infirm Rodney, then returns it to the table.)
Mary-land, Mr. Samuel Chase. 
Virginia, Mr. Thomas Jefferson. 
North Carolina, Mr. Joseph Hewes. 
South Carolina, Mr. Edward Rutledge. 
Georgia, Dr. Lyman Hall.

As the last man signs, the sound of the tolling Liberty Bell in the belfry above becomes almost deafening.
Then the scene freezes for a brief instant, and the pose of the familiar Pine-Savage engraving of this occasion has been captured.

A scrim curtain falls, the scene visible through it. Then as the back-light dims and the curtain is lit from the front, it becomes opaque and reveals the lower half of the Declaration, featuring the signatures.

>CURTAIN<
